# Recap

- pointer to pointer is useful when we need to change the address
  of where the pointer points to (in a function)
- pointer to pointer is not the same as pointer to array of pointers
  - esp. in a function
- explicit casting
  - sometimes needed even for integer types (e.g. in `printf` arguments)
  - handy for pointers to structures
  - when casting pointers beware of alignment issues
- heap allocation
  - always check return values of functions that allocate memory!
  - risk of memory leaks: use static/dynamic checkers
- no need to cast when working with `void *`

# :wrench: warm-up strsepc

implement

```C
      char *strsepc(char **stringp, int c);
```

which behaves like strsep(3) except that it searches only for the first
occurence of single character.

Try to use strsep() first :eyes: [strsep.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/strsep.c)

# 2D array initialization

Static array initialization is just an extension of 1D array initialization.  It
is an array of arrays, so each element of the array (of arrays) is an array
initializer.  You initialize by rows.

        int a[MYSIZE][MYSIZE] = {
                {  0,  1,  2,  3 },	// a[0]
                {  4,  5,  6,  7 },	// a[1]
                {  8,  9, 10, 11 },	// a[2]
                { 12, 13, 14, 15 },	// a[3]
        };

code: :eyes: [2d-static-array-initialization.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/2d-static-array-initialization.c)

C stores the array in a single piece of memory, consequtively, row after row.
That means that all but the last dimension must be known.  So you could do:

	int a[][3] = {
                {  0,  1,  2 },
                {  4,  5,  6 },
                {  8 },		// a[2][1], a[2][2] implicitly initialized to 0
                { 12, 13, 14 },
	}

However, you cannot do:

	int a[][] = {
                {  0,  1,  2 },
                {  4,  5,  6 },
                {  8,  9, 10 },
                { 12, 13, 14 }	// no comma here, that's OK, but it's
				// recommended to use it to make it consistent
	}

```
xxx.c:12:7: error: array has incomplete element type 'int []'
        int a[][] = {
	     ^
```

Note that in C99, you may or may not use a comma (`,`) after the last
initializer.  In C89, it was prohibited to use the comma after the last one.

Remember that we do not have to set all elements of the row when initializing an
array, the C compiler will zero out the rest.

	int a[10] = { 1, 2 }; // from a[2] to a[9], elements are 0

Neither you can do the following (same compiler error as above).  As the
compiler stores the array data in rows, if it does not know how long is the row,
it cannot proceed.

	int a[4][] = {
                {  0,  1,  2 },
                {  4,  5,  6 },
                {  8,  9, 10 },
                { 12, 13, 14 }
	}

You already know that you can initialize a character array using a string
instead of `{ 'a', 'b', ... }`:

	char s[] = "hello, world";

Same way you can initialize an array of strings:

	char *s[] = {
		"hello",
		"hi",
		"good day",
		"what's up"
	};

However, while string is technically an array of characters, it's an expression
whose value is the address of the 1st element of the array, i.e. the 1st char.
However, `{ 'a', 'b', ... }` is an initializer for a static array, it is not a
pointer.  So, the following will not compile:

	char *s[] = {
		{ 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' },
		{ 'h', 'i', '\0' }
	};

Also note that the following two lines mean something quite different:

	char a[] = "hello, world";
	char *p = "hello, world";

In the first case, the string is only used to initialize a static array.  You
cannot assign anything to `a` after that but you can change the array's
elements.

In the second case, a static string is created and stored in the binary (i.e.
the program file), and `p` contains its address, i.e. the address of character
`'h'`.  One can change the `p` variable to point to something else but it is
undefined what happens when one tries to change the characters of the string.
With gcc, all such strings are read only:

	$ cat main.c
	#include <sys/types.h>

	int
	main(void)
	{
		char *p = "hello, world";

		*p = 'H';
		return (0);
	}
	$ gcc main.c
	$ ./a.out
	Bus error: 10

# Unions

- similar to structures however have different semantics
	- stores its members in the same memory location
	- allows for different "views" of the same data
- usually combined with structures
- handy for efficient data storage or HW programming

consider this declaration:
```C
union foo {
	unsigned short i; // 2 bytes
	struct {
		unsigned char low;
		unsigned char high;
	} bytes;
};
```
  - the `sizeof(union foo)` will be that of its largest member
  - modify a value of `i` and it will be reflected in the low/high values
    because `i` and `bytes` share the same location

```
		0             high memory addresses
		+-------------+
		|      i      |
		+-------------+
		| low  | high |
                +-------------+
```

- union can be part of a structure, :eyes: [union-in-struct.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/union-in-struct.c)
  and vice versa :eyes: [struct-in-union.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/struct-in-union.c)
- union can be "anonymous" (e.g. no name inside of a structure), however this is
  non-standard just like for structures

:wrench: Task: use the above declaration to find out if the program is running
on big or little endian system (least significant byte is stored on lowest
address). The program will print either "big endian" or "little endian" to
standard output.

# Storage classes

- two classes - *automatic* and *static*
- declaration within a block creates an automatic object
- the storage class determines the lifetime of the storage associated with the
  identified object
- only one storage class specifier may be given in a declaration
- objects declared outside of any block is always of the static storage class
  (e.g. global variables).
- static objects retain their value upon reentry to functions and blocks.
- you can initialize a static object.  The initialization happens just once.

code: :eyes: [fn-static-object.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/fn-static-object.c)

This one also shows how to use `goto`.  More on that later.

code: :eyes: [block-static-object.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/block-static-object.c)

# Static variables and functions

  - if the function is declared `static`, it is visible only from the same
    object file

  - static variables: retain value across function calls
  - yes, the word `static` is overloaded in C

# Internal vs external linkage

Static objects with the keyword `static` are of internal linkage, meaning they
are not seen from other compilation units.  Static objects without the keyword
`static` are implicitly external.

Use `extern` keyword for objects that are defined in a different compilation
unit.

Example:

	$ cc linkage.c ext.c
	Undefined symbols for architecture x86_64:
	  "_si", referenced from:
	      _main in linkage-917564.o
	ld: symbol(s) not found for architecture x86_64
	clang: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see
	invocation)

:eyes: [linkage.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/linkage.c)
:eyes: [ext.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/ext.c)

Also note that each object must have exactly one definition.  For objects with
internal linkage, this rule applies separately to each translation unit, because
internally-linked objects are unique to a translation unit.

# Function pointers.

A function name is a pointer to the function.  You can pass it as an argument.

	int
	myadd(int a, int b)
	{
		return (a + b);
	}

	int
	process_numbers(int a, int b, int (*f)(int, int))
	{
		return ((*f)(a, b));
	}

## :wrench: argv sorting

Use `qsort(3)` function to sort `argv`, and print it sorted then.  Check the man
page, you will need to write a function that can compare two elements of the
array you provide to the `qsort()` function.

First use `strcmp()` to sort the argument alphabetically, then use `atoi()` to
sort them numerically.

After that, come up with another way of sorting the arguments and write a
function for it as well.

:key: Code: :eyes: [argv-sort.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/argv-sort.c)
(for alphabetical sorting only)

# Home assignment: mygetopt

implement a command line parser ala getopt(3). The global variable
'myoptarg' will be set if an option has an argument.

Note: call the function `mygetopt()` not to intermingle with the standard
library's `getopt()`.  Implement the "POSIXly correct solution", i.e. stop once
non-option argument is encountered (i.e. one not starting with `-`) or after the
`--` option is reached.

:wrench: bonus task: implement myoptind/myopterr/myoptopt variables

See the following code on how to use getopt(3):
