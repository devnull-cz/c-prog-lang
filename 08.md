# Program arguments

```C
int main(int argc, char *argv[]);
```

  - `argv` is declared as an array of pointers
    - i.e. `argv[i]` is a pointer to char
  - the arguments of `main()` can have arbitrary names however please stick
    to the convention to avoid confusion of those who might be reading your
    program

  - `argc` is a number of command line arguments, including the command name
    itself (in `argv[0]`).

  - `argv[i]` are arguments as strings.  Note, they are **strings** even if you put
    numbers there on the command line.

  - `argv[argc]` is NULL by definition.

Note: remember (see lecture 07 notes) that in a function argument, an array is
      always treated as a pointer so the above effectively becomes:
```C
        int main(int argc, char **argv);
```
  i.e. in this context, char `*argv[]` and char `**argv` are the same.

  The declaration merely hints at the memory layout.

Also, you already know that you can use an array notation with characters as
well, so you could use `argv[i][j]` to print individual characters.  Just make
sure that it's not out of range.

- the memory for `argc`, `argv` is allocated before `main()` is called
  - the standard (C99) leaves unspecified where argc/argv are stored

    > section 5.1.2.2.1: the strings pointed to by the argv array shall be
    modifiable by the program, and retain their last-stored values between
    program startup and program termination.

- the `argv` is array of pointers to null-terminated strings and must be
  terminated by a `NULL` pointer. (quote from the execve(2) man page)

:wrench: Task: find a distance between the first occurence of character `<a>` and `<b>` in a
string `<string>`.  If either of the character is not found in the string, print
an error.
```
./a.out a x "ahello xworld"
7
```
Note: do not use `strchr()` or the like.

:wrench: Task:

  - print all command line arguments using `argc`
  - print all command line arguments using just `argv`
  - print all command line arguments not starting with `-`
  - print all command line arguments using a recursive function (that accepts pointer to pointer to char)

Note: for all arguments print their address as well
Note: do not print the terminating `NULL` entry
      - some `printf()` implementations barf on NULL pointer when printing
        via the `%s` format string

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:wrench: Task: print the n-th character of the r-rd argument (count from 0), do not
count `argv[0..2]`.  If not enough arguments or the argument is not long enough,
print a helpful message.  Only use pointers, do NOT use square brackets (ie.
`argv[i][j]` is NOT allowed).
```
./a.out 2 3 hey hi world
l
```
Note: use atoi() to convert the first 2 arguments to integers

- usage: semi-formal specification of program arguments
  - usually used to print when invalid option or arguments are specified
  - can be handled via errx()
  - the usage usually contains program name followed by the argument schema
    - see e.g. the nc(1) man page
  - optional arguments are enclosed in square brackets, mandatory arguments
    are enclosed in `<>` or left without brackets

Task: write a program that takes 1 or 2 arguments, if run with any other count,
      print usage and exit.

# Operator precedence

`*p++` is `*(p++)` as `++` is of higher priority than `*`.  However, the value of the expression
is still `*p` though as `p` is incremented after the expression is evaluated.

:wrench: Task: determine the outcome of these expressions/declarations:
  - `*p++`
  - `++*p`
  - `int *p[2]`
  - `int (*p)[3]`
