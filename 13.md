# Building with a concrete C specification version

If you want to make sure your code is built following a concrete C version, it
has two parts:

- you must request the C specification version in your C code
- you need an implementation (compiler, linker, ...) that supports the version
  you want

## Limiting your code to the specific C spec version

In [C89](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c89-draft.html), there was no
`__STDC_VERSION__` macro (note there are two underscores both leading and
terminating the macro).  In the [Normative Addendum
1](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c89/c94_na1.html) for C89 from 1994, the macro was
defined with a value of `199409L`.  In the [C99
specification](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.pdf) (there is also a [handy
txt only version](http://port70.net/~nsz/c/c99/n1256.txt), the macro has a value
of `199901L`.

So, if you want your compiler to use a minimal or a specific C version, work
with the macro and `#ifdef` and `#error` preprocessor directives.

```C
#ifndef __STDC_VERSION__
#error "__STDC_VERSION__ not defined.  C99 compiler or greater required."
#else
#if __STDC_VERSION__ < 199901L
#error "C99 compiler or greater required."
#endif
#endif
```

## Compiler version

In the [1997: Single UNIX Specification (SUS) version
2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification#1997:_Single_UNIX_Specification_version_2),
with systems supporting that version as UNIX98, the compiler binary supporting
C89 had to be named `c89`.  You can [search SUS ver 2
here](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/7990989775/), and type `c89`.

In
[POSIX:2004](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_UNIX_Specification#2004:_POSIX:2004),
which is SUS ver 3 with updates, the C compiler binary supporting C99 standard
had to be named `c99`.  The [latest SUS
version](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/) (as of May, 2020)
still defines `c99`.  I expect the future SUS versions with require `c11` binary
to support C11 standard.

TODO: c89 on macOS, gcc -std=c99, c89 on macOS with `_Bool`

Might be difficult to get the compiler work as the exact specification version.
For example, the following will compile while `//` are not part of C89, and
moreover, `_Bool` is not either and it does not issue even a warning.

```
janp:air:~$ cat main.c
int
main(void)
{
	// not in C89
	_Bool b;
}
$ c89 main.c
main.c:4:2: warning: // comments are not allowed in this language [-Wcomment]
        // not in C89
        ^
1 warning generated.
$ gcc -std=c89 -pedantic main.c
main.c:4:2: warning: // comments are not allowed in this language [-Wcomment]
        // not in C89
        ^
1 warning generated.
```

# Flexible array member

- since C99 (ยง6.7.2.1, item 16, page 103)
- it is an array without a dimension specified as the **last member** of the
  structure
  - handy for structures with a fixed header and some "padding" data of flexible
    length that is allocated dynamically
  - why not to use a pointer instead?  It is good when passing data over
    boundaries such as network, kernel/userland, etc. since no structure
    copy is required.
    - just copy the structure as a whole (however, it is necessary to know how
      large is the padding) because it is all contiguous memory
- `sizeof (the_structure)` gives you the size of the structure **as if
  the flexible array was empty**.

Example:

```C
struct item {
	int value;
	// possible other members
	char payload[];
	// nothing can follow
};
```

`sizeof (struct item)` will give the size **without the last member computed**

```
+-------------+-----------------------+
| struct item |      payload ...      |
+-------------+-----------------------+
```

Previously, this was hacked around using array with 0 members and GCC accepted
this.  Since C99 this can be done properly using this technique.

The extra data is allocated as follows:

```C
struct item *p = malloc(sizeof (struct item) + payload_len * sizeof (p->payload[0]));
```

- with this approach the overall structure alignment might be lost
  - i.e. it is necessary to set the payload length according to the size
    of the structure if you want to maintain the alignment

# Structure bit fields

- sometimes memory is scarce (imagine having to keep millions of big structures
  in memory) and there are members holding integer values that occupy just a
  couple of bytes
  - *bit fields* can be used to shrink the memory needed

```C
struct foo {
	unsigned int a : 3;
	unsigned int b : 1;
	unsigned int   : 4;
};
```

- the number after the colon specifies the number of bits for a given bit field
  - cannot exceed the size of the underlying data type (`unsigned int` in the
    above example)
- you cannot use `sizeof` on a bit field

- this is good for implementing network protocol headers or HW registers,
  however the layout of bit fields in a C structure is implementation dependant
  - if it needs to match a concrete layout, additional non-standard compiler
    features have to be used (`#pragma`'s etc.)
  - there is no `offsetof()` for bit fields

:eyes: [bitfield.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/bitfield.c)

- the integer values will behave as expected, e.g.

```C
struct foo_s {
	unsigned int a : 3;
} foo;

foo.a = 7;
foo.a++; // will wrap around to 0 since this is unsigned
```

# Non-transparent handles may cause issues

If your library is statelful, the state is often managed by a handle
used as an argument in the library function calls.  Let's say internally in the
library we need to track some ID and a position.  Those members are expected to
be used only by the library itself so the consumers of the library should use
the handle in a transparent way.   That is, they should not care nor use
whatever is inside the handle.

```C
/* mylib.h */
struct ml_hndl {
	int ml_id;
	int ml_pos;
};

/* mylib.c */
struct handle *
ml_init(void)
{
	/* allocate and init the handle first */
	/* ... */

	return (h);
}

/* mylib.c continues */
enum ml_err
ml_parse(char *url)
{
	enum ml_err e = ML_OK;

	/* parse the URI */
	/* ... */

	return (e);
}

/* ... */
```

And the consumer would use it as follows:

```C
#include <mylib.h>

int
main(void)
{
	ml_err ret;
	struct ml_hndl *h;

	h = ml_init(void);
	if ((ret = ml_parse("some URI")) != ML_OK)
		errx(1, "...");

	/* ... */
}
```

So far, so good.  However, what if the consumer code delves into the handle and
uses the information in there (because the header file is part of the library
and available to the consumer)?

```C
int
main(void)
{
	/* ... */

	print_debug("[Debug] handle ID: %d\n", h->md_id);

	/* ... */
}
```

This will work fine until the library provider changes the handle (believed to
be internal to the library):

```C
/* mylib.h */
struct ml_hndl {
	long long ml_id;	/* used to be an int */
	int ml_pos;
};
```

Unless the consumer code is recompiled after the change, which may not happen as
it could be some 3rd party software bought by the customer years ago, the debug
print is now incorrect as it only prints the first 4 bytes of the structure, not
8.

There are ways to mitigate that:

- use something non-revealing as a handle, like in index to the internal array
  of structures that keep the states.  That is possible but you now need to
  manage the internal structure that keeps the state structures.  You also
  cannot change the index type unless you recompile all the consumers as well.
- the library provider could use something called *incomplete types* and use
  them to provide an opaque (transparent) handle.

# Incomplete types

An *incomplete type* is a type that describes an object but lacks information
needed to determine its size.  You cannot declare objects using such types as
the lack of the size prevents to allocated memory for them on the stack or heap.

```
$ cat main.c
struct x a;	/* declaring a variable using a structure of an unknown size */

int
main(void)
{
}

$ cc main.c
main.c:1:10: error: tentative definition has type 'struct x' that is never
      completed
struct x a;
         ^
main.c:1:8: note: forward declaration of 'struct x'
struct x a;
       ^
1 error generated.
```

The `x` structure could be completed, for all declarations of that type, by
declaring the same structure tag with its defining content later in the same
scope.  We could only *forward declare* the structure though (that is, no
defining any object of that structure type).

As we do not need to know the size of the `x` structure, the following code
compiles.

```
$ cat main.c
struct x;	/* this is called forward declaration */

int
main(void)
{
}

$ cc main.c
$ echo $?
0
```

BTW, the `void` type is an incomplete type that can be never completed.  So, you
cannot declare a variable of type `void`.

```C
$ cat main.c
int
main(void)
{
	void x;
}

$ cc main.c
main.c:4:7: error: variable has incomplete type 'void'
        void x;
             ^
1 error generated.
```

However, you can always declare and work with a pointer to an incomplete type
(all structures are always aligned to the same byte boundary).  The following
will compile and run fine.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

struct x *
myfn(struct x *p)
{
        return (p);
}

int
main(void)
{
        myfn(NULL);
}
```

This feature of the C language can be used to represent opaque handles, and
those can be used to solve the
[problem with non-transparent handles](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/non-transparent-handles.md)
.

# Opaque structures (handles)

With the help of incomplete types, it is possible to declare a structure in a
header file along with API that consumes it without revealing what the structure
actually contains.  The reason to do that is not to allow a programmer to depend
(= use) on the structure members, thus allowing to change the structure innards
anytime.

```C
/* Forward declaration in foo.h */
struct foo;

void
do_stuff(struct foo *f);
```

The file implementing `do_stuff()` **will retype the opaque structure object to
an internal structure type**.

```C
/* in foo_impl.h not provided to the consumers */
struct foo_impl {
    int x;
    int y;
};

/* library implementation code */
void
do_stuff(struct foo *f)
{
	struct foo_impl *fi = (struct foo_impl *)f;

	fi->x = ...
	fi->x = ...
}
```

Then any `.c` file that includes `foo.h` can work with the structure
(by passing it to `do_stuff()`) however cannot access its members directly.
The structure is usable only via a pointer. Thus, the library has to provide
a function to allocate a structure and return the pointer to it
(and possibly also to initialize it) and functions to get/set the data
inside the structure.

This is handy for libraries so they are free to change the layout of structures
without breaking the consumers.

The consumer of the library then `#include`s only `foo.h` but it does not have
access to `foo_impl.h`.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

#include "foo.h"

int
main(void)
{
	struct foo *h;

	h = getFoo();
	doStuff(h);
}
```
