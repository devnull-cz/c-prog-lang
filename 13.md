# Non-transparent handles may cause issues

If your library is statelful, the state is often managed by a handle
used as an argument in the library function calls.  Let's say internally in the
library we need to track some ID and a position.  Those members are expected to
be used only by the library itself so the consumers of the library should use
the handle in a transparent way.   That is, they should not care nor use
whatever is inside the handle.

```C
/* mylib.h */
struct ml_hndl {
	int ml_id;
	int ml_pos;
};

/* mylib.c */
struct handle *
ml_init(void)
{
	/* allocate and init the handle first */
	/* ... */

	return (h);
}

/* mylib.c continues */
enum ml_err
ml_parse(char *url)
{
	enum ml_err e = ML_OK;

	/* parse the URI */
	/* ... */

	return (e);
}

/* ... */
```

And the consumer would use it as follows:

```C
#include <mylib.h>

int
main(void)
{
	ml_err ret;
	struct ml_hndl *h;

	h = ml_init(void);
	if ((ret = ml_parse("some URI")) != ML_OK)
		errx(1, "...");

	/* ... */
}
```

So far, so good.  However, what if the consumer code delves into the handle and
uses the information in there (because the header file is part of the library
and available to the consumer)?

```C
int
main(void)
{
	/* ... */

	print_debug("[Debug] handle ID: %d\n", h->md_id);

	/* ... */
}
```

This will work fine until the library provider changes the handle (believed to
be internal to the library):

```C
/* mylib.h */
struct ml_hndl {
	long long ml_id;	/* used to be an int */
	int ml_pos;
};
```

Unless the consumer code is recompiled after the change, which may not happen as
it could be some 3rd party software bought by the customer years ago, the debug
print is now incorrect as it only prints the first 4 bytes of the structure, not
8.

There are ways to mitigate that:

- use something non-revealing as a handle, like in index to the internal array
  of structures that keep the states.  That is possible but you now need to
  manage the internal structure that keeps the state structures.  You also
  cannot change the index type unless you recompile all the consumers as well.
- the library provider could use something called *incomplete types* and use
  them to provide an opaque (transparent) handle.

# Incomplete types

An *incomplete type* is a type that describes an object but lacks information
needed to determine its size.  You cannot declare objects using such types as
the lack of the size prevents to allocated memory for them on the stack or heap.

```
$ cat main.c
struct x a;	/* declaring a variable using a structure of an unknown size */

int
main(void)
{
}

$ cc main.c
main.c:1:10: error: tentative definition has type 'struct x' that is never
      completed
struct x a;
         ^
main.c:1:8: note: forward declaration of 'struct x'
struct x a;
       ^
1 error generated.
```

The `x` structure could be completed, for all declarations of that type, by
declaring the same structure tag with its defining content later in the same
scope.  We could only *forward declare* the structure though (that is, no
defining any object of that structure type).

As we do not need to know the size of the `x` structure, the following code
compiles.

```
$ cat main.c
struct x;	/* this is called forward declaration */

int
main(void)
{
}

$ cc main.c
$ echo $?
0
```

BTW, the `void` type is an incomplete type that can be never completed.  So, you
cannot declare a variable of type `void`.

```C
$ cat main.c
int
main(void)
{
	void x;
}

$ cc main.c
main.c:4:7: error: variable has incomplete type 'void'
        void x;
             ^
1 error generated.
```

However, you can always declare and work with a pointer to an incomplete type
(all structures are always aligned to the same byte boundary).  The following
will compile and run fine.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

struct x *
myfn(struct x *p)
{
        return (p);
}

int
main(void)
{
        myfn(NULL);
}
```

This feature of the C language can be used to represent opaque handles, and
those can be used to solve the
[problem with non-transparent handles](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/non-transparent-handles.md)
.

# Opaque structures (handles)

With the help of incomplete types, it is possible to declare a structure in a
header file along with API that consumes it without revealing what the structure
actually contains.  The reason to do that is not to allow a programmer to depend
(= use) on the structure members, thus allowing to change the structure innards
anytime.

```C
/* Forward declaration in foo.h */
struct foo;

void
do_stuff(struct foo *f);
```

The file implementing `do_stuff()` will contain:

```C
struct foo_impl {
    int x;
    int y;
};

void
do_stuff(struct foo *f)
{
	struct foo_impl *fi = (struct foo_impl *)f;

	fi->x = ...
	fi->x = ...
}
```

Then any `.c` file that includes `foo.h` can work with the structure
(by passing it to `do_stuff()`) however cannot access its members directly.
The structure is usable only via pointer. Thus, the library has to provide
a function to allocate a structure and return the pointer to it
(and possibly also to initialize it) and functions to get/set the data
inside the structure.

This is handy for libraries so they are free to change the layout of structures
without breaking the consumers.
