<h1>ViM tips for source code file editing</h1>

<p>You can find lots of tutorials on ViM.  This page contains a few
tips that may help you when editing C source code files.

<p>If you are looking for an IDE like environment with ViM, you can check <a
href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/blog/2014/11/23/way-vim-ide/">Turning
vim into an IDE through vim plugins</a>.

<p>First advice is to use <code>:help <i>word</i></code> (colon included) for
searching through ViM's on-line help.  So if you want to learn about how to
split your terminal into separate windows, use <code>:help windows</code>

<p>In my experience, whatever I was looking for, I found in ViM.  The only thing
missing is running a shell in a terminal window, editing the output, and using
it again as shell input --  that is what Emacs supports.

<p><tt>^X</tt> means <tt>Ctrl+X</tt> where <tt>X</tt> is small 'x'.

<ul>
	<li>always use 'smartindent'.  Sometimes set by default.  Put "set
	smartindent" to <tt>~/.vimrc</tt>, or type ":set si" if in ViM.  With
	this setting, ViM will greatly help with indenting.  And yes, indenting
	by a tabelator is a good thing in C source code.

	<li>Pressing <tt>K</tt> while for a word under the cursor will invoke a
	manual page for that word.  Sometimes <tt>nK</tt> works to use a
	specific manual page section.

	<li><tt>[i</tt> within a word will search the current file upwards and
	also through all include files (recursively) for the word and displays
	the last line found with the word on the status line.  Very often it is
	a definition or a declaration of such a variable, function, etc.

	<li><tt>[^I</tt> similar to <tt>[i</tt> but it will jump there.  See
	below on how to jump back.

	<li><tt>gf</tt> will display a file under the cursor ("go file").  Also
	works for include files as ViM knows where such files are located by
	default.  You can also help ViM with other directories that should be
	searched for files (not just for <tt>gf</tt>), use <tt>set pa=...</tt>
	in your <tt>.vimrc</tt> file.

	<li>If you jump somewhere, including searching for a string via
	<tt>/</tt> or displaying another file via <tt>gf</tt>, ViM keeps a stack
	of such positions.  You can go up and down the stack with <tt>^O</tt>
	and <tt>^I</tt>.  So if you use <tt>[^I</tt> to jump somewhere, use
	<tt>^O</tt> to jump back.

	<li>In the insert mode, <tt>^P</tt> will complete the current word with
	whatever it can find in the current file and include files (upwards).
	So, if you start with <tt>PTHREAD_M</tt>, you have included
	<tt>&lt;pthread.h&gt;</tt>, and press <tt>^P</tt>, ViM will complete to
	<tt>PTHREAD_MUTEX_INITIALIZER</tt>.  Press again, it will offer another
	matching word.

	<li><tt>%</tt> will jump to a matching parenthese

	<li><tt>*</tt> will search for a word under the cursor.  <tt>#</tt> will
	search backwards.  After the first search, you can use <tt>n</tt> to
	search for next occurences.

	<li><tt>&gt;&gt;</tt> indents a current line to the right by a shift
	width (a tabelator by default).  Use <tt>set sw=N</tt> to change that to
	<tt>N</tt> spaces.  Also works with <tt>&lt;&lt;</tt>.

	<li>Visual blocks and indenting: make a block (<tt>V</tt> then move the
	cursor), then use <tt>&gt;</tt> or <tt>&lt;</tt> to move the whole block
	horizontally.  Also try <tt>v</tt> a <tt>^V</tt>.  After an indentation
	you can use a period to repeat the last action.  To indent back, use
	<tt>u</tt> for undo or <tt>&lt;</tt> and <tt>&gt;</tt>.

	<li><tt>[{</tt> jumps to the beginning of a program block.  Similarly
	<tt>]}</tt>.  Great if you want to jump to the begining of a cycle,
	function, etc.
</ul>
