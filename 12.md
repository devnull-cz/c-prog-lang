# :wrench: Warm-up

Task: write a program that counts the number of bits that need to be flipped so
      that number A becomes number B.

Note: use the character representation only for debug prints. The actual
      operations with the numbers are to be done with bit operations on
      integers.

Note: consider only positive integers

# :wrench: Warm-up/home task

Task: detect if an integer has alternating bits, e.g. 10101

Note: this can be done in O(1) using bit operations + arithmetics
