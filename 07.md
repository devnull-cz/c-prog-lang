# Warm-up

Print a circle of a chosen radius.  Use a define for the radius so that you can
test other sizes.  This is for 12, for example:

```
$ ./a.out
            *
        **** ****
      **         **
     *             *
    *               *
   *                 *
  *                   *

 *                     *



*                       *



 *                     *

  *                   *
   *                 *
    *               *
     *             *
      **         **
        **** ****
            *
```

Hint: an equation for a circle is `x^2 + y^2 = MYRAD^2`, ie.

```
y = sqrt(MYRAD * MYRAD - x * x);
```

Obviously, there are more ways how to do it.

- the easiest way is to use a two-dimensional array and go through the `x` axis
  and fill the corresponding `y` value before printing out the array line by
  line.
  - to print the array, instead of printing it a character by character, we can
    also use array lines as strings if we terminate each line first with a `\0`.
- you could print the output line by line, that is, figure out what to print on
  each line.  You do not need a two-dimensional array then, and speaking of
  which, not even an array at all.

You can find the `sqrt()` function declaration in `<math.h>`.

On Linux, you will need to link with the math library to get the `sqrt()`
function code, ie:

```
$ gcc -lm warm-up.c
```

An extension: fill the circle up.

```
$ ./a.out
            *
        *********
      *************

# Pointer size

```
int *p;
```

`sizeof (p)` is an **address size**, in our case either 32 or 64 bits depending
on how your code was compiled.

```C
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	int *p;
	printf("%zu\n", sizeof (p));
}
```

```
$ cc main.c
$ file a.out
a.out: Mach-O 64-bit executable x86_64
$ ./a.out
8
```

The `sizeof (*p)` is equivalent to `sizeof (int)` (as that is what the type of
`*p` is).

# Arrays and pointers

In C, there is a strong relationship between arrays and pointers.  Most of the
time, you can use array notation with pointers, and pointer notation with
arrays.

By definition, the value of a variable or an expression of type array is the
address of an element zero of the array.

```
int *pa;
int a[4] = { 1, 2, 3, 4 };

pa = &a[0];     // [] is of higher precedence than &
pa = a;         // this gets the same result as above

p[0] = 3;	// the array is now { 3, 2, 3, 4 }
*(a + 1) = 5;	// the array is now { 3, 5, 3, 4 }
```

heavy\_exclamation\_mark: As you can see, incrementing a pointer increments the
value **by the size of the object the pointer points to**.  Another example:

```
int a[] = { 0, 1, 2 };
int *p = a;

printf("%d\n", *(p + 2));       // will print 2
```

[ptr-inc.c](/src/ptr-inc.c)

heavy\_exclamation\_mark: While you can work with arrays and pointers together,
**arrays are not pointers** and **pointers are not arrays**.  To work with a
pointer, the generated code must first get the value of the pointer variable,
then work with it.  With arrays, the generated code directly works with the
memory address the array starts at.  See below.

## Array variables are not modifiable

You cannot do the following:

```
int a[1];
int aa[1];
++a;            // error
a = aa;         // error
```

When assigning to an array element, the compiler generates code that assigns to
a piece of memory representing the element using an offset from the beginning
of the array.

```C
int a[1];

a[0] = 15;
```

The generated assembler code (e.g. `objdump -d` from LLVM) for the above assigns
15 directly to the piece of memory on the stack (started by the base pointer
`rbp`) that represents the first array element.  That also hints that one cannot
assign to an array variable in C as it would need a special semantics that would
not fit the way C works with arrays.

```
100000fa6:      c7 45 fc 0f 00 00 00    movl    $15, -4(%rbp)
```

# Strings, arrays, and pointers

We already went through [basics on strings and string
literals](/modules/strings.md).

Given that a string constant is internally used to initialize an array of
`char`s, and an array name represents its first element memory address, the
value of a string is an adress of its first character.

:eyes: [string-const-address.c](/src/string-const-address.c)

You can use an array notation with pointers.  So, if you **really** wanted, you
could do something like this:

```C
printf("%c\n", "hello, world"[1]);	// will print `e`
```

## Strings and pointers

Given that a string constant is a pointer to its first character, we can use it
like this:

```
char *p = "hello";

printf("%c\n", p[1]);   // will print 'e'
```

:eyes: [array-notation-with-ptr.c](/src/array-notation-with-ptr.c)

:heavy\_exclamation\_mark: Pointer initialized with a string literal **may not**
be changed in the same way as array.  Whether the internal array created and
initialized from the string literal lays in read-write or read-only memory is
implementation defined.  For `gcc` and `clang`, it is read-only memory.

:eyes: [string-literal-write.c](/src/string-literal-write.c)

And as you can use a pointer notation with arrays (we already mentioned that the
array name is a synonym for the address of its first element), you can do this:

```
char a[] = "hello, world";

printf("%c\n", *(a + 1));       // will print 'e'
```

[ptr-with-array-notation.c](/src/ptr-with-array-notation.c)

# Valid pointer operations

Valid pointer operations are:

- assignment of pointers of the same type
- adding or subtracting a pointer and an integer
- subtracting or comparing two pointers to members of the same array
- assigning or comparing a pointer to zero

All other pointer arithmetic are invalid operations and may or may not trigger a
warning.

More specifically, assigning an integer to a pointer is not a valid operation,
usually you get a warning.

```C
int
main(void)
{
	int *p = 0x1234;        // is not a valid behavior
}
```

```
$ cc int-to-ptr.c
int-to-ptr.c:4:7: warning: incompatible integer to pointer conversion initializing 'int *' with an
      expression of type 'int' [-Wint-conversion]
        int *p = 0x1234;        // is not a valid behavior
             ^   ~~~~~~
