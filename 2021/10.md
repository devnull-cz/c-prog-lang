# heap/dynamic allocation: malloc()/free()

The memory automatically allocated for local variables and function parameters
is allocated in an area called a *stack*. There is an area called a *heap* to
allocate memory that lasts after the function returns. This is also called
*dynamic allocation*.

The allocator in the standard C library offers the
`malloc`()/`calloc`()/`free`()/...  APIs for heap allocation.

:heavy\_exclamation\_mark: The `malloc`/`calloc` functions return a pointer to a
memory area of a specified size or a null pointer if the allocation failed -
always check that!  (even on Linux where it seems it can never fail - to be
prepared for change in a configuration and also for portability to systems with
more conservative memory allocation).

```C
#define	ARRLEN	20
int *p;

if ((p = malloc(ARRLEN * sizeof (int))) == NULL)
	err(1, "malloc");
p[0] = 99;
p[ARRLEN - 1] = 77;
```

The prototype for `malloc` is as follows:

```C
void *malloc(size_t size);
```

Note that as `malloc` returns `void *`, there is no need to explicitly type its
result when assigned to a pointer.  That is, do not use:

```C
int *p;

p = (int *)malloc(16);
```

See `man malloc` for more memory allocation related functions.

# Pointer to a structure and type casting

- pointers to structures are often used to achieve common interface for
  different types

  - e.g.

```C
struct Common { int type; };
struct A      { int type; char data[8]; };	// type == 1
struct B      { int type; char data[16]; };	// type == 2
```

- then a function can be declared like so:

```C
int func(struct Common *c);
```

- internally it can do e.g.:

```C
if (c->type == 1) {
	struct A *ap = (struct A *)c;
	ap->data[7] = 'A';
} else if (c->type == 2) {
	struct B *bp = (struct B *)c;
	ap->data[15] = 'B';
}
```

This is possible since all the structures have the same member on the same
offset (that is offset 0).  However, note that you need to cast properly to
avoid warnings.  See the code below.

A function may also allocate an `A` or `B` structure and return its address as a
pointer to the `Common` struct.  This pointer then needs to be casted in the
caller according to its first member.

See `struct sockaddr`, `struct sockaddr_in` and `struct sockaddr_in6`
definitions as an example on how this is done in practice.


# :wrench: Home assignment

Note that home assignments are entirely voluntary but writing code is the only
way to learn a programming language.

# Linked list

Declare a structure that will form a simple linked list and will hold an integer
as a value.  The program will be run with a single argument specifying how many
items the list will have.

Allocate a new structure and insert into the head (global variable).  Each new
item will have its value incremented by one.

Aside from the value itself, each node needs to hold a pointer to the next
structure in the list.  The last node has the next pointer set as NULL.

Once the list is complete, print its value by traversing its items from head to
end.

```
$ ./a.out
a.out: usage: ./a.out <num>
$ ./a.out 10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
0
```

# Memory leaks

The C runtime does not have a garbage collector so all heap allocated memory has
to be explicitly freed via `free`() after it is no longer needed.  If not freed,
that creates a resource leak called a *memory leak* as the allocator deems such
memory used even that your code no longer uses it.  Depending on the problem
this might cause the problem of running out of memory later on, and then
`malloc`/`calloc` can start returning a null pointer.

The leaks can be checked using static or dynamic analyzers.

:wrench: write a program that takes all arguments that follow `argv[0]`,
concatenates them (without the terminating `NUL` character) into one string
dynamically allocated via `malloc`() and prints this string to the standard
output.

  - the concatenation can be done either by hand (try that first) or strncat()
    (try that afterwards)

:eyes: [argv-concat.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/argv-concat.c)

You can then put the string processing in a loop and comment out the `free`()
call on the allocated memory.  Then check with `top -s 1` on Linux, macOS, or
any other Unix-like system (or use any other suitable system monitoring tool)
that the memory size of the running program quickly increases.
