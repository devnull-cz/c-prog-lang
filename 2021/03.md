# Warm-up: count words

Print out number of words read from the standard input.  Ideally, use your
`getchar` based code from your repository to start with.

**Always try to reuse code you have already written!**  Then do not forget to
upload it to your
[source code management repository.](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/scm.md)

A *word* is defined as a group of any characters surrounded by whitespace
characters.  For our case these white space characters will suffice: a
tabelator, a space, and a newline.

- write your own check for a whitespace character, do not use library functions
  for that

- check correctness of your implementation with `wc -w <file>`

- what happens if the number of words exceeds the type that stores the count?

:eyes: [words.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/words.c)
actually uses a library check for white space for simplicity.

another solution is :eyes: [words2.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/words2.c)
It is even simpler than the first solution while not using the library function.

Example:

```
$ cat /etc/passwd | ./a.out
70
```


# Array Intro

You define an array like this `<element-type> array[<some-number>]`, for
example:

```C
int array[5];
```

The integer value `n` in `[n]` specifies the number of array *elements*.

- an array *subscript* always starts from `0` and ends with `n - 1`
- a subscript may be any integer expression
- the type of array elements is called an *element type*

So, `int array[3]` elements will be accessible as `a[0]` .. `a[2]`, each element
is of type `int`, and therefore you can do e.g. `printf("%d\n", a[2]);`.

- `0` as the first subscript so it is easier to work with *pointers* and
  efficiency for array access - we will get to pointers later.

- what is not possible to do with arrays in C (limitations are important
  knowledge):

	- associative arrays
	- array subscripts returning a sub-array (like found e.g. in Python)
	- assigning to an array as a whole

- as with integer and floating point variables, we may initialize an array
  during its definition.  In general, the value for the initialization is known
  as an *initializer*.

```C
short array[3] = { 1, 2, 3 };
```

If the array size is omitted the compiler will compute the size from the the
number of initializers.  So, you can just do the following.

```C
short array[] = { 1, 2, 3 };
char array[] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```

Note that if you need your array to contain only the elements from the
initializer, omitting the array size is the way to go to avoid errors as in
changing the initializer while forgetting to update the array size.

- the `sizeof` operator on array always gets **the array size in bytes**.  It
  will **not** get the array size in elements.

  	- to get the number of elements in an array, you must divide the array
	  size in bytes by the size of its element.  Always use `0` subscript,
	  see below on why.

```C
int a[5];

printf("Elements in array: %zu\n", sizeof (a) / sizeof (a[0]));
```

The above is the correct approach that is immune to changing the array
declaration (i.e. the type of elements).  Do not use the following:

```C
    sizeof (array) / sizeof (int)
```

:wrench: Declare an array of `char`s without setting the array size, initialize
the array during declaration (see above), then print each element of the array
on a separate line using a `while` loop.

Arrays introduced so far are not dynamic and **can not** be resized.

- try to perform out-of-bound access. What is the threshold for
  behavior change on your system ?
- why is it not faulting for the one-off error?

:eyes: [array-out-of-bounds.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/array-out-of-bounds.c)


```
$ ./a.out
Number of array elements: 1024
One-off error (using index 1024)... OK
Assigning to index 4096... Segmentation Fault
```

You can also try to locate where it crashed.  For more information, see
[some info on debugging.](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/debugger.md)

You do not need to initialize all elements.  With such type of an
initialization, you always start from subscript `0`, and there are no gaps:

```C
  short array[4] = { 1, 2, 3 };
```

In the example above, the elements not explicitly initalized are set to `0` so
the value of `array[3]` will be initialized to `0`.

- i.e. `int array[100] = { 0 };` will have all values set to `0`

- the initialization is done by a compiler

- using `= {}` is not allowed by the C specification (allowed in C++) but
  generally accepted.  Not with `-Wpedantic` though:

```
cc -Wpedantic test.c
test.c:1:13: warning: use of GNU empty initializer extension
      [-Wgnu-empty-initializer]
int a[10] = {};
	    ^
1 warning generated.
```

Note: **global variables are always zeroized.**

There is a *partial array initialization* where the *initializers* are called
*designated initializers* in the C spec:

  char array[128] = { [0] = 'A', [2] = 'f', [4] = 'o', [6] = 'o' };

- a subscript is in square brackets
- the `[subscript]` is known as a *designator*.  Inreasing ordering is not
  required but expected.
- the rest of elements will be initialized to zero
- if you do not specify the array size, it is taken from the highest designator
  index
- you can combine designators with fixed order initializers, and you always
  start with the next index.  For example:

```C
  /* a[5] is 'e' etc.  a[0]..a[3] are NUL characters (= zero bytes). */
  char a[128] = { [4] = 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```

- you cannot specify a repetition or setting multiple elements to the same value
  (there is a gcc extension for that but let's not go there).

:eyes: [array-designated-initializers.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/array-designated-initializers.c)

Note the code above mentions a missing `=` as a GCC extension.  With a non-GCC
compiler it does not compile:

```
$ cc array-designated-initializers.c
"array-designated-initializers.c", line 15: syntax error before or at: 'A'
cc: acomp failed for array-designated-initializers.c
```

Once declared, the values cannot be assigned at once.  So, you can only do
things as follows:

```C
int array[4];

array[0] = 1;
array[1] = 2;
array[2] = array[3] = 3;
// ...
```

You cannot assign an array into array - has to be done an element by element.

- likewise for comparison

Arrays cannot be declared as empty (`int a[0]`).

- this is explicitly forbidden by the standard, see
[C99](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/c99-standard.md)
6.7.5.2 Array declarators.
- GCC accepts that though.  Do not use it like that.

:eyes: [empty-array.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/empty-array.c)

This might be a bit confusing though:

```
$ gcc empty-array.c
$ ./a.out
4
0
```

Even if a compiler supports an empty array declaration, `sizeof(a) /
sizeof(a[0])` construction is always correct to compute a number of array
elements.  Plus, remember the compiler does not do any array access when
computing `sizeof(a[0])` as the expression is not evaluated (see
[the sizeof operator](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/sizeof.md)
), the compiler only uses the argument to determine the size.


# Function introduction

Functions can be used to encapsulate some work, for code re-factoring, etc.

A function has a single return value and multiple input parameters.

- if you also need to extract an error code with the value or get multiple
  return values, that needs to be done via passing data via reference (more on
  that when we have pointers)
- i.e. this is not like Go that returns an error along with the data

A function *declaration* is only declaring the API without its body.  In C, it
is called a *function prototype* and it consists of a type, a function name, and
an argument list in parentheses.  For example:

```C
int digit(int c);
int space(int c);
float myfun(int c, int i, float f);
```

When *defining* the function, its body is inclosed in `{}` (just like the `main`
function).

```C
int
return_a_number(void)
{
	return (1000);
}
```

Also as with the `main` function, you can use `void` instead of the argument
list to say the function accepts no arguments.  You could just use `()` to
indicate the function has no arguments but that is an old way of doing things
and in that case the compiler will not verify the number of arguments when
calling the function (you can check it out for yourself).  So, always use
`(void)` if the function has no arguments.

```C
void
hola(void)
{
	printf("Hola!\n");
}
```

A function call is an expression so you can you it as such:

```C
printf("%d\n", return_a_number());
```

The default return value type is an `int` but a compiler will warn if it is
missing.  You should always specify the type in
[C99+](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/c99-standard.md)
. You may use `void` which means the function does returns no value.

Write your function declarations at the beginning of a C file or include those
into a separate header file.

If a compiler hits a function whose prototype is unknown, warnings are issued.
Remember :eyes: [hello-world1.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/hello-world1.c)
? See also here:

```
$ cat test.c
int
main(void)
{
	fn();
}

float
fn(void)
{
	return (1.0);
}
$
$ gcc test.c
test.c:4:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'fn' is
invalid in C99
      [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
	fn();
	^
test.c:8:1: error: conflicting types for 'fn'
fn(void)
^
test.c:4:2: note: previous implicit declaration is here
	fn();
	^
1 warning and 1 error generated.
```

Argument names may be omitted in prototypes, i.e.:

```C
int myfn(int, int);
```

A variable defined in function parameters or locally within the function
overrides global variables.  Each identifier is visible (= can be used) only
within a region of program text called its *scope*.  See
[C99](/modules/c99-standard.md), section *6.2.1 Scopes of identifiers* for more
information.

Within a function body, you may use its arguments as any other local variables.

```C
int
myfn(int i, int j)
{
	i = i * j;
	return (i);
}
```

As **arguments are always passed by value** in C, the variable value is not
changed in scope that called the function.

```C
/* myfn defined here */

int
main(void)
{
	int i = 3;

	myfn(i, i);
	printf("%d\n", i);	// will print 3
}
```

Local variables are on the stack.

Variable passing depends on bitness and architecture. E.g. 32-bit x86 on the
stack, 64-bit x64 ABI puts first 6 arguments to registers, the rest on the
stack.

Functions can be recursive. :eyes: [recursive-fn.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/recursive-fn.c)

```C
/*
 * Print 0..9 recursively using a function call fn(9).
 */
#include <stdio.h>

void
myfn(int depth)
{
	if (depth != 0)
		myfn(depth - 1);
	printf("%d\n", depth);
}

int
main(void)
{
	myfn(9);
}

```

:wrench: Print 9..0 using a recursive function.

# Arrays and functions

Arrays in C are not a first class object, rather it is a composition of
elements.

An array **cannot be returned from a function**.  A pointer to an array can be
but more on that later.

No allowing to return an array is done for efficiency as copying the whole array
(by value) would be too expensive.

- watch for size of an array as a local variable in a function
- arrays as local variable may significantly increase the stack size (and a
  stack size is limited in threaded environments)

:eyes: [func-large-array.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/func-large-array.c)

The following may or may not happen in your environment:

```
$ cc func-large-array.c
$ ./a.out
Segmentation fault: 11
```

# Array of characters

An array of characters (`char`s) is called a *string* or a *string constant*.
Do not confuse it with a *character constant* as in `'A'` (single quotes) that
is actually an `int`.  A string is put in double quotes `""`.

So, `"hello, world"` as string.

Technically, a string constant is an array of characters and may be used to
initialize a char array:

```C
char foo[] = "bar";
```

A special thing is that a string is always terminated by a NUL (zero) byte.
That is how C knows where a string ends.

That means the size of the array is **one byte more than the number of
characters in the string**.  It is because of the terminating zero (`\0`) that
the compiler adds to terminate the string.

So, you could use an initializer as introduced earlier:

```C
char foo[] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', '\0' };

printf("%zu\n", sizeof (foo));		// prints 4
printf("%zu\n", sizeof ("bar"));	// prints 4
```

However, that is not generally used as you would normally use `"bar"` to
initialize such an array.

Using `'\0'` suggests it is a terminating NUL character, and it is just a zero
byte.  So, you could just use `0`, like this, but it is not generally used:

```C
char foo[] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', 0 };
```

To print a string via `printf`(), you use the `%s` conversion specifier:

```C
printf("%s\n", foo);
```

:wrench: What happens if you forget to specify the terminating zero in the above
per-char init and try to print the string ?

# Why does it work?

Let's look at the following code.  Obviously, the function does not return its
value while it definitely should have.  What happens if we use the function
return value anyway?

:eyes: [why-it-works.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/why-it-works.c)

```C	
#include <stdio.h>

int
addnum(int n1, int n2)
{
        int n = n1 + n2;
}

int
main(void)
{
        printf("%d\n", addnum(1, 99));
}
```

It simply cannot work, right?  **Oh, wait..., it does!?!**

```
$ cc why-it-works.c
$ ./a.out 
100
```

**So what happened???**

Well, I does not really work.  It "works" by accident.  Let's look at it more
closely.  To establish a common environment, I will be using
u-pl3.ms.mff.cuni.cz which you all have access to, so that you can try and see.
Before I begin, let me give you more information:

- it depends on a system and its version, and a compiler and its version
	- you can also try the `clang` compiler later on the same machine
- will be using `gcc` which defaults to generate 64 bit binaries on the Linux
  distro installed on u-pl3.ms.mff.cuni.cz (and other machines in the lab).
- 64 bit binaries on x86 use [X86-64 ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86-64)
- [ABI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_binary_interface) is not
  [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface)
- by this ABI (it's law!), the first two function integer arguments are passed
  through the general purpose **edi** and **esi** registers
- integer function return value is passed back to the caller via the general
  purpose **eax** register
- **the stack on x86 grows down**

Let's compile the code and disassemble it.  All we need are the `main` and
`addnum` function.  See my notes inline.

```

    114c:	89 75 e8             	mov    %esi,-0x18(%rbp)

	- here we put both function arguments on a stack.  As we already
	  learned, function arguments may be used within a function as local
	  variables, so they need to be on a stack.

	- why we put them to -0x14 and -0x18 offsets from the base?  That's just
	  what this gcc version does.  They are 4 bytes apart as we work with 4
	  byte integers.

    114f:	8b 55 ec             	mov    -0x14(%rbp),%edx
    1152:	8b 45 e8             	mov    -0x18(%rbp),%eax

	- moved the values of our local variables to general purpose registers

    1155:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax

    	- sum up the values.  As we add edx to eax, the result is in eax.

    1157:	89 45 fc             	mov    %eax,-0x4(%rbp)

	- put the result to the local variable "n" which happens to be at offset
	  -0x4 from the frame pointer.

	- now, see above, register eax is used in x86 64 ABI for the function
	  return value.  So, by accident, we have the "right" value in the
	  register that is supposed to hold the return value!!!

	- x86 64 ABI expects the function return value in the register eax, so
	  we just put it to the input register esi representing the 2nd argument
	  for the printf() function.
	- and, given that we happened to have the right value in eax, the code
	  looks like it works.

What if we increment variable `n`, does it change anything?

```
int
addnum(int n1, int n2)
{
	int n = n1 + n2;
	++n;
}

$ gcc main.c 
./a.out

```

Apparently not, let's see the disassembled code:

```

    1149:	89 7d ec             	mov    %edi,-0x14(%rbp)
    114c:	89 75 e8             	mov    %esi,-0x18(%rbp)
    114f:	8b 55 ec             	mov    -0x14(%rbp),%edx
    1152:	8b 45 e8             	mov    -0x18(%rbp),%eax
    1155:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax
    1157:	89 45 fc             	mov    %eax,-0x4(%rbp)
    115a:	83 45 fc 01          	addl   $0x1,-0x4(%rbp)

    	- OK, the compiler just directly adds 1 to the memory address holding
	  local variable "n".  As it does not change the register eax, it still
	  "works".

    115e:	90                   	nop
    115f:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
    1160:	c3                   	retq
```

So, let's involve another local variable.

```
int
addnum(int n1, int n2)
{
	int n = n1 + n2;

	int i = 13;
	n = i + n;
}

$ gcc main.c
$ ./a.out
13
```

Bingo!  It no longer "works".  What happened?

```

    1155:	01 d0                	add    %edx,%eax

    	- this was summing up our two function arguments

    1157:	89 45 f8             	mov    %eax,-0x8(%rbp)

	- the result went to the local variable "n"

    115a:	c7 45 fc 0d 00 00 00 	movl   $0xd,-0x4(%rbp)

	- we initialized local variable "i" (0xd in hexa is 13 in decimal)

    1161:	8b 45 fc             	mov    -0x4(%rbp),%eax

	- See?  Now we used eax for further arithmetic operations.  We just put
	  the current value of local variable "i" to the register.

    1164:	01 45 f8             	add    %eax,-0x8(%rbp)

	- and we added the register value to the present value of local variable
	  "n".  And as 13 was left in eax, that served as the function return
	  value.

    1167:	90                   	nop
    1168:	5d                   	pop    %rbp
    1169:	c3                   	retq
```

main.c:7:1: warning: control reaches end of non-void function [-Wreturn-type]

What we should take away from this situation:

- anything looking as working does not mean it is correct
- ideally, if possible, test on different architectures (like x86, SPARC, ARM,
  etc).
- using different compilers and different systems may help as well.  For
  example, if you develop in a Linux distro, testing it also on a macOS laptop
  would be worth it.
- if something magically stops working that did work before, be ready for
  breakage like this.  Even something that has worked for ages does not
  necessarily means the code must have been correct.
- always use `-Wall -Wextra` GCC options when building your code.  More on that
  later in the seminar.  See that `clang` warns by default which is a good
  thing.

**Do you want more information on x86 ABI and how it really works behind the
scene?** Search for [Solaris Crashdump Analysis Frank
Hofmann](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=Solaris+Crashdump+Analysis+Frank+Hofmann) for
more details.

You probably do not want [all the gory

# :wrench: Home assignment

Note that home assignments are entirely voluntary but writing code is the only
way to learn a programming language.

## :wrench: Count digit occurrence (use arrays)

Write a simple program on counting
[the digit occurence](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/count-digit-occurence.md)
as in one of the previous classes but now use an array for counting the figures.

## :wrench: Count digits, white space characters, and the rest

Print total number of (decimal) numbers, white space (tab, space, newline) and
anything else from the input.  **I.e. the program prints out three numbers.**

Obviously, reuse code you wrote for digit occurence counting:
:eyes: [count-digit-occurence.md](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/count-digit-occurence.md)

- write the program using direct comparisons like this:

```C
c >= '0' && c <= '9'
c == ' ' || c == '\t' || c == '\n'
```

- put both the checks into separate functions
- then write a new version of the program and use:
        - use `isspace`() from C99
	- `isdigit`() vs `isnumber`() - the latter detects digits + possibly
	  more characters (depending on locale setting)

## :wrench: Count letter occurrence

- count occurrences of all ASCII letters on standard input and print out
  a histogram
- this will be case insensitive (i.e. implement `mytolower(int)` first)

- the output will look like this:

```
$ cat /some/file | ./a.out
a: ***
b: *
c: *****************************
...
z: *******
$
```

- use a function to print a specific number of stars
- use a function to do all the printing
- declare array(s) to be as efficient as possible
	- that is, having the lowest possible size
	- only use global variables if necessary
