<a href="http://mff.cuni.cz/">MFF UK</a>, summer semester 2024/2025.<br>
<b>Mal&aacute; Strana, Monday 9:00 @ SU2 lab</b><br>
Lectured by: Jan Pechanec, Vladim&iacute;r Kotal<br>
Department: <a

First lecture: Feb 17

<h2>Overview</h2>

<blockquote>
<!--
<p><i>"C is not a big language, and it is not well served by a big
book."</i>
-->
<p><i>"Since C is relatively small, it can be described in a small
space, and learned quickly.  A programmer can reasonable expect to know
and understand and indeed regularly use the entire language."</i>
<p>-- Brian W. Kernighan, Dennis M. Ritchie
</blockquote>

<p>The seminar is lectured in English unless everybody present can speak
Czech.  <b>It is a recommended pre-requisite for <a
href="https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/">Unix/Linux
Programming in C (NSWI015).</a></b>

<h2>Abstract</h2>

<p>The hands-on seminar is meant to teach students how to program in C.
It is targeting people who have no prior experience with the language.
The seminar is not an introductory programming class.  It assumes some
familiarity with basic programming concepts like variables, assignment
statements, loops, and functions.  The C standards C90 and C99 will be
covered.  Strong emphasis will be put on writing real C programs taking
advantage of all the language features discussed.

<h2>Target Group</h2>

<p>This seminar is primarily targeting people who have no prior experience with
the C language.  However, all are welcome, and we believe everybody can learn
something new in this class.

<h2><a name="developmentenvironment">Development Environment</a></h2>

<p>What you need for this seminar?  Just a C compiler and a text editor.
There are a few options:

<ol>
<li>You can work directly on Linux desktops in the SU2 room.  You will need your
MFF UK unix login/password to get in.  We assume you will know the minimum
needed to use the system.  Start a few terminals and that is all you need.  The
compiler is <tt>gcc</tt>.  See below for a few editor options.
<li>Some Linux machines in the Malá Strana from the Rotunda lab are still
remotely accessible via SSH with your unix MFF UK login.  To log in, use e.g.
<code>ssh yourname@u-pl1.ms.mff.cuni.cz</code>.  You can also check <code>ssh
-M</code> as that might come in handy to speed up multiple logins.  Presently,
due to the Rotunda lab ongoing reconstruction, there are only <tt>u-pl1</tt> and
<tt>u-pl10</tt> machines available for an SSH login.  Pick either of those, your
home directory is mounted on both.  You can use <a
href="https://putty.org">PuTTY</a> client on Windows.  Windows 10 already have
OpenSSH.  Then see the item above.  <li>Use your laptop with a GNU C
(<code>gcc</code>) compiler installed, or any other modern C compiler.  Any
Linux distro, (Free|Net|Open)BSD, or a macOS machine will do but you may need to
install the compiler there.  On macOS, just run <tt>cc</tt> and follow the
instructions there.  <li>Install a C compiler on your Windows laptop.
<li>Various combinations of the above in a virtual machine (e.g.  open source <a
href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a> runs on many platforms).
</ol>

<p>There is Eduroam WiFi available in the SU2 lab, you can connect to the lab
machines from your laptops via SSH, see above.

<h3>Development Tools</h3>

<p>We recommend to work from the terminal only, there is really no need
for an IDE.  We use <a href="http://www.vim.org">ViM</a> (on Linux
distros and macOS as <code>vi</code>) and the compiler.  If you are in
the first year and did not go through the Unix intro lecture yet, the
<code>vi</code> editor may not feel friendly at first, in that case <a
href="https://joe-editor.sourceforge.io">Joe</a> is a good alternative.
It is also installed on all Linux lab machines as <code>joe</code>.  You
can also use GNU <a href="https://www.nano-editor.org/">nano</a> which
is very easy to use as well.

<p>If you can create a simple C program, compile it, and successfully
execute the resulting binary
<code><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1218262/why-do-some-compilers-use-a-out-as-the-default-name-for-executables">a.out</a></code>, you are good to go.
For example:

<pre>
$ cat main.c
int
main(void)
{
}
$ cc main.c
$ ./a.out
$ echo $?
0
</pre>

<h2><a name=gettingcredits">Getting credits</a></h2>

<p>To get credits, you complete a given assignment in C as a home
project.  The project submission is via sending us email with a link to
an online repository we can use with Git or Mercurial (e.g. <a
href="http://github.com">GitHub</a>).  You need to send the email to
both of us, see the contacts below.  Sending your code as an attachment
<b>will not be accepted</b>.

<p>We need to receive the email before the deadlines, anything after the
deadline will not be accepted.

<p>Tests to verify your implementation will be provided with the assignment.
<b>You must pass all the tests</b> before handing over your solution.  We will
build your code and verify the tests on <code>u-pl1.ms.mff.cuni.cz</code>
machine in the <a href="http://www.ms.mff.cuni.cz/labs/index.html.en">MFF UK lab
at Mal&aacute; Strana</a>, see the <a href="#developmentenvironment">Development
Environment</a> section above. If your code does not pass all the tests there,
the submission will not be accepted.

<p><b>You are supposed to write the code by yourself.  Taking any existing code
is strictly prohibited except for specific exceptions noted in the
assignment.</b>

<p>The assignment has two phases.  First has a <b>deadline of TBD, 2025,
23:59:59, CEST</b> (= local Prague time), which is the end of the summer
semester tuition period.  The 2nd phase has a <b>deadline of TBD, 2025,
23:59:59, CEST</b>, which is the end of the summer semester examination period.
Please note that the <b>deadlines are hard</b> and failing them means you are
forfeiting your chance to get the credits for this year.

<p>You can submit the whole thing in one step before the first deadline, no need
to separate the project in two parts.

<p>If you need to finish your semester earlier (that may apply to Erasmus
students), you need to finish the 2nd assignment in full before that.

<p>Assignment definition: TBD

<!--
<p><a
href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/getting-credits/2024/assignment.txt">The
assignment</a> for both phases.

<p> FYI, our implementation of the 1st phase is about 400 lines of well
commented code that conforms to the <a
href="https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/cstyle.html">recommended
C style.</a>  The 2nd phase is below 500 lines.

<h2>Seminar Notes</h2>

<p>Seminar repository is <a
href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/tree/master/">work
in progress</a>.  There is a <a
href="https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/tree/notes">direct link
to the generated notes in Markdown format</a>.  A <a
href="https://devnull-cz.github.io/c-prog-lang/notes.html">HTML version of the
notes</a> is provided as well.

<!--
<p><a href="./2019">Notes from the previous year</a> for your reference.

<h2>C style for writing code</h2>

<p>We strongly encourage you to use a good <a
href="https://devnull-cz.github.io/unix-linux-prog-in-c/cstyle.html">C
style</a> to follow when writing C code.  It comes with a Perl script to
check your style.  <b>We just cannot stress enough the importance of
readable code with a unified look.</b>

<p>There are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indent_style">other
indent styles to choose from.</a>
