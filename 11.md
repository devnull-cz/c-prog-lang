# Warm-up

Declare a 3-d array of 2x2x3 `int`s and statically initialize it with numbers
1..12.  Retype the array as 1-d and print all elements.  You should get then:

```
$ ./a.out
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12
```

# The last initializer and a comma

In C89, having a comma after the last initializer was a syntax error.  Since
C99, it's optional.

```C
struct s {
	int a;
	int b;
} s = { 1, 2, };	// ',' after 2 is optional
```

See why keeping the last comma always there might be a very good idea:

# Enumeration constant

We already know integer constants, character and string constants, a
floating-point constant, constant expression (an expression that involves only
constants).

There is one other kind of constant, the "enumeration constant".  An enumeration
is a list of constant integer values, as in:

```C
enum boolean { NO, YES};
```

The first name has value `0`, the next one `1`, etc.  You can use explicit
values as well.  Unspecified values continue to progress from the last value
specified.  For example:

```C
enum months {
	JAN = 1,
	FEB,
	MAR,
	APR,
	MAY,
	JUN,
	JUL,
	AUG,
	SEP,
	OCT,
	NOV,
	DEC,
};
```

You could also do as follows:

```C
enum weird {
	one = 3,
	two,		// 4
	three = 3,
	four = 0,
	five,		// 1
	six,		// 2
	seven = -1,
	...
}
```

The list consists of *enumerators*.  I.e. both `JAN = 1` and `FEB` are
enumerators.  When used in code, `JAN`, `FEB`, `MAR` etc. are *enumeration
constants*.  The values of enumeration constants must fit an `int`.  However,
the implementation may define any integer type to be compatible with the
enumerated type under the condition that all enumeration constants fit the type.
So, the implementation **might** choose a `char` to be compatible with the `enum
boolean` above.

```C
enum white_space { NL = '\n', SP = ' ', TAB = '\t' };
```

The `sizeof` operator applied on an enum itself tells you the integer type used
(`sizeof (enum weird)`), and `sizeof` on any enumeration constant gives you the
same number.

**Names** in different enumerations must be distinct.  In other words, all
enumerators share the same name space.  Values in the same enumerations need not
be distinct, e.g.:

```C
enum not_really_useful { GGG = 1, HHH = 1, GHGH = 0 };
```

Example: :eyes: [enums.c](src/enums.c), [enum-values.c](src/enum-values.c)

## Use `enum`s!

This:

```C
enum commands {
	XXX_LIST,
	XXX_EXTRACT,
	XXX_CREATE
}
```

is so much better than this:

```C
#define	XXX_LIST	0
#define	XXX_EXTRACT	1
#define	XXX_CREATE	2
```

The reason is that the enum is known to the compiler and may be included into
debug symbols.  So, when debugging, you might, if the compiler/debugger support
it, see `XXX_LIST` instead of just `0`.  In the latter case, as the compiler
only see the numbers when compiling the code, you will never see any symbolic
names.  So, seeing the symbols instead of common numbers `0` or `1` is really
helping.

# The `const` keyword

`const` is a *qualifier* that may be applied to the declaration of any variable.
It specifies its value cannot be changed.  If you apply `const` to an array, the
array elements cannot be modified.

You can initialize the variable declared with the `const` qualifier.

:eyes: [const.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/const.c)

Using `const` will not really make the storage constant, you just cannot use
that variable for an assignment to the storage.

```C
int i = 'c';
int const *i2 = &i;

// illegal
*i2 = 'x';
// ok
i = 'x';
```

:eyes: [const-not-really-a-const.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/const-not-really-a-const.c)

It also depends where you apply the `const` keyword.

```C
char const *s1;		// s is a pointer to const char
const char *s1;		// same as above
char *const s2;		// s is a const pointer to a char

*s1 = 'c';		// illegal
s1 = NULL;		// legal

s2 = NULL;		// illegal
*s2 = 'a';		// legal
```

:eyes: [const-and-pointers.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/const-and-pointers.c)

Using `const` can get a bit confusing.  It is mostly used for pointer arguments
to constant memory to specify that an array will not be changed in the function.
For example, string functions:

```C
size_t strlen(const char *s);
char *strncpy(char *dest, const char *src, size_t n);
...
```

:wrench: `const`

The following is a `const` pointer to a `const` character.  So, you can neither
do `*p = ...` nor `p = ...`.  Verify.

```C
const char *const p;
```

# The `typedef` keyword

- note that a `char`, signed and unsigned integer types, and the floating types
  are collectively called *basic types*.
- then you have *derived types* - an array type, a structure, a union, a
  function type, a pointer type.

With `typedef`, you create new data type **names** for **existing** types.  Note
that you **never** create new data **types** with `typedef`.  In other words,
with `typedef`, you create synonyms to existing types.

`typedef` is most commonly used for derived types but many C provided names by
the standard are based on basic types.  For example, `size_t`, see its
definition in `/usr/include/sys/types.h`.

`typedef` is used as follows:

```C
typedef int myint;
typedef *char mycharptr;

mycharptr *p = "my string";
```

`typedef` is also great to create complex type names in small steps.  As we will
see next.

```C
typedef char **array[10];
array a;
```

:eyes: [derived-types.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/derived-types.c)

The convention is to add `_t` to a new type name.  For example:

```C
typedef struct mystruct_s {
	int a;
	char c;
} mystruct_t;
```

And you can use it like this:

```C
struct mystruct_s x;
mystruct_t y;
```

`x` and `y` are of the same type.

:eyes: [typedef.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/typedef.c)

:wrench: Task

Use `typedef` in the warm-up code for the item structure and use the new name
instead of `struct item ...`.

# Variable name space and scope

Identifiers fall into several name spaces that do not interfere with one
another.

These distinct classes are:

- objects, functions, `typedef` constants
- labels
- tags of structures or unions, and enumerations
- structure or union individually

The "individual" part means each structure or union has its own namespace.  So,
you can have two different structures, each using the same member names.

:eyes: [identifier-name-space.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/identifier-name-space.c)

# Reading complex declarations

To read a complex declaration, you use operator priorities and watch for
parenthess.

```C
char **argv
```

`argv` is a pointer to a pointer to `char`

```C
int (*a)[10]
```

`a` is a pointer to an array of 10 `int`s

```C
int *a[10]
```

`a` is an array of 10 pointers to `int`

```C
void *myfunc()
```

`myfunc` is a function returning a pointer to `void`

```C
void (*myfunc)()
```

`myfunc` is a pointer to a function returning `void`

```C
char (*(*x())[])()
```

`x` is a function returning pointer to an array of pointers to a function
returning a `char`

```C
char (*(*x[3])())[5]
```

`x` is an array of 3 pointers to a function returning a pointer to an
array of 5 `char`s

## How to read it

1. find the identifier (non keyword or custom type) of a variable or function
2. start decoding:
        - left to right
        - `)`  => reverse decoding direction
        - `()` => denotes function
        - `[]` => array
        - `;`  => reverse the direction
        - when reading from right to left, we can hit:
        - `(`   => reverse the direction
        - `*`   => pointer
        - type identifier => starts the whole definition

Example:
```C
char *(*(**foo[][8])())[];
```

You can mentally simplify as:

```C
char *(*SOME_FUNCTION)[];
```

Where `SOME_FUNCTION` is `(**foo[][8])()`

Read as:

`foo` is an array of arrays of 8 pointers to a pointer to a function
returning a pointer to an array of pointers to a `char`.

Alternatively, you can do it via two simpler steps:

```C
typedef char *a_of_p[];
typedef a_of_p *(**foo[][8])();
```

:wrench: Practice:

```C
int *(*(*fp1)(int))[10];
char (*(*x())[])()
double *f()[]           // this is not legal in C as a function cannot
                        // return an array
```

# Bitwise operations

:wrench: Task

Print `argv[1]` in binary (assume it is a correct decimal number).  Note that
`printf`(3) does not have a conversion specifier for it (unlike 'x' for hexa and
'o' for octal).  Limit the input to positive `int`s.  Do not use bit operators
even if you know how to (ie. do NOT use `>>` etc.)

To verify, use bc(1) with `obase=2`.  E.g.:

```
$ bc
obase=2
10
1010
255
11111111
2^31-1
1111111111111111111111111111111

$ ./a.out 2147483647
1111111111111111111111111111111
$ ./a.out 255
11111111
$ ./a.out 348508345
10100110001011101000010111001
```

You can also use `obase=8`, `obase=16`, etc.  Note that bc(1) takes only capital
letters as digits, ie. use "E4" for 0xe4, not "e4".  "e4" is treated as a
variable:

```
$ bc
ibase=16
obase=2
e4
0
E4
11100100
```

:eyes: [print-in-binary.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/print-in-binary.c)

Bitwise operators are as follows:

Operator | Meaning
--- | ---
`&`	| bitwise AND
`\|`	| bitwise OR
`^`	| bitwise XOR
`<<`	| left shift
`>>`	| right shift
`~`	| one's complement (unary)

Note, individual bits are being processed.  I.e.:

```
316 & 978			-> convert to binary to see it
100111100 & 1111010010		-> do logical AND bit by bit now

0100111100
1111010010
----------
0100010000	== 272 (use ibase=2 with bc(1) to verify)
```

So,

```
((338 & 978) == 272).	// == is of higher prority than &
```

Common uses of bitwise operators:

```C
n = n & 01777;			// zero out some lowest bits

/*
 * Setting individual flags.  Note that each of the flags has
 * just one bit set.
 */
#define	LIGHT_OFF	0x0000
#define	LIGHT_GREEN	0x0001
#define	LIGHT_RED	0x0002
#define	LIGHT_BLUE	0x0004
#define	LIGHT_YELLOW	0x0008
#define	LIGHT_VIOLET	0x0010
#define	LIGHT_WHITE	0x0020
// ...

lights = lights | LIGHT_YELLOW;	// turn on yellow light
lights = lights & ~LIGHT_RED;	// turn off red light
```

## Binary operators and integer promotion

When working with bitwise operators, operands are promoted the same way
as we learned in lecture 05 (see "Various conversions and promotions").
That means:

```
13U & -1				-> promote int (-1) to unsigned,
					   i.e.  promote -1 to unsigned.
					   You get:

13 & 4294967295				-> now convert to binary
1101 & 11111111111111111111111111111111	-> the result clearly is 1101
```

## `getbits`()

Implement a function `getbits(x,p,n)` that returns the (right adjusted) `n`-bit
field of `x` that begins at position `p`.  We assume that bit position `0` is at
the right end and that `n` and `p` are sensible positive values.  For example,
`getbits(x,4,3)` returns the three bits in positions 4, 3 and 2, right-adjusted.

The idea is to zero out anything that is to the left of `p`, then shift those
`n` bits to the very right, and you get the result.

```C
/* 1 0000 0000: should return 1 */
i = getbits(0x100, 8, 1);
(void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
assert(i == 1);

/* 1110 0100: should return 9 */
i = getbits(0xe4, 5, 4);
(void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
assert(i == 9);

/* 1010 1010: should return the same number, ie. 0xAA */
i = getbits(0xAA, 7, 8);
(void) printf("0x%X\n", i);
assert(i == 0xAA);
```
