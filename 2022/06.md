# Strings and String Constants

We already know what a
[string](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/string.md)
is.  It is an array of non-null characters terminated by a null byte.  The null
character is part of the string.

- A *string literal* is a sequence of zero or more characters enclosed in
  double-quotes, as in `"xxx"`.  It is also called a *string constant*.

	- do not confuse it with a *character constant*, e.g. `'A'`, as it uses
	  single quotes.  In contrast to Python, for example, single and double
	  quotes are two different things in C.

- **a string constant internally initializes an array of characters, with a null
  character appended.**

- that also means that a string literal may include multiple null characters,
  thus defining multiple strings.  Note that a *string literal* and a *string*
  are two different things even that people mostly both call a string.

```C
$ cat main.c
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	printf("%s\n", "hello\0world.");
}
$ cc main.c
$ ./a.out
hello
```

- `'\0'` is just a special case of octal representation `'\ooo'`,
  called *octal escape sequence*, where `o` is an octal figure (0-7).  You can
  use any ASCII character like that.

	- the full syntax is `'\o'`, `'\oo'`, or `'\ooo'`.  `\6` is another
	  example of an octal character sequence while `\8` is illegal.

```C
$ cat main.c
/*
 * The code assumes that our environment uses ASCII but that is not mandatory.
 * See 5.2.1 Character Sets in the C99 standard for more information.
 */
#include <stdio.h>

int
main(void)
{
	/* Check the ascii manual page that 132 is 'Z', and 71 is '9'. */
	printf("%c\n", '\132');
	printf("%c\n", '\71');
	/* Will print "a<tab>b" */
	printf("a\11b\n");
}
$ ./a.out
Z
9
a	b
```

- a string constant may be used to initialize a `char` array and usually that is
  how the string initialization is used (in contrast to `{ 'a', 'b', ... }`)

```C
int
main(void)
{
	char s[] = "hello, world.";

	printf("%s\n", s);
}
```

```
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra main.c
$ ./a.out
hello, world.
```

- remember that if `{}` is used for the initialization, **you must add the
  terminating zero yourself** unless you use the size of the array and the
  string was shorter (in which case the rest would be initialized to zero as
  usual):

```C
char s[] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
```

- so, the following is still a propertly terminated string but do not use it
  like that

```C
char s[10] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o' };
```

Anyway, you would probably never do it this way.  Just use `= "hello"`.

printf("%s\n", "hello, world");
```

# Warm-up

- :wrench: write code to print the output further below using a single `printf`
  with a single conversion specification like this:

```
printf("%s\n", str);
```

- Your code must not have `x` in it.  The only string literal allowed in your
  code must be `"%s\n"` in `printf`.

```
$ grep x main.c
$
$ grep '".*"' main.c | grep -v 'printf.*%s'
$
```

Expected output follows (`<tab>` means a literal tabelator character):

```
hello
world
<tab>x
'
```

# The `for` loop

Formally defined as:

```
for (<init>; <predicate>; <update>)
	<body>
```

It is the same as:

```
<init>
while (<predicate>) {
	<body>
	<update>
}
```

Using the for loop is very often easier and more readable.

Example:
```C
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
	printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

Or in C99:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i) {
	printf("%d\n", i);
}
```

- the `break` statement terminates execution of the loop (i.e. it jumps right
  **after** the enclosing `}`)

- with the `continue` statement, the execution jumps to the end of the loop body
  (i.e. it jumps **at** the enclosing `}`) but the `<update>` part is executed.
  The execution then continues with the `<predicate>` test.  Example:

```
for (int i = 0; i < 3; ++i) {
	printf("%d\n", i);
	continue;
	putchar('a');
}

$ ./a.out
1
2
3
$
```

- both `break` and `continue` statements relate to the smallest enclosing loop
  they are executed in

# Expressions

> "In mathematics, an expression or mathematical expression is a finite
combination of symbols that is well-formed according to rules that depend on
the context."

In C, expressions are, amongst others, variables, constants, strings, and
expressions in parentheses.  Also arithmetic expressions, relational
expressions, function calls, `sizeof`, assignments, and ternary expressions.

http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/expressions

In C99, an expression can produce results (`2 + 2` gets `4`) or generate side effects
(`printf("foo")` sends a string literal to the standard output).

:eyes: [expression-statement.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/expression-statement.c)

:wrench: task: make the warning an error with your choice of compiler (would be
a variant of `-W` in GCC)

# Statements

Statements are (list not complete): expressions, selections (`if`, `switch` (not
introduced yet)), `{}` blocks (known as *compounds*), iterations, and jumps
(`goto` (not introduced yet), `continue`, `break`, `return`).

http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/statements

Basically, statements are pieces of code executed in sequence. The function body
is a compound statement. The compound statement (a.k.a. *block*) is a sequence
of statements and declarations.  Blocks can be nested.  Blocks inside a function
body can be used for variable reuse but should be used for that with care, if at
all.

A semicolon is not used after a compound statement but it is allowed.  The
following is valid code then, and does essentially nothing:

```C
int
main(void)
{
	{ }
	{ };
}
```

**A declaration is not a statement** (there are subtle consequences, we can show
them later).

Some statements must end with `;`.  For example, expression statements.  The
following are all valid expression statements.  They do not make much sense
though and may generate a warning about an unused result.

```C
/* this one is not a statement */
char c;

/* these are all expression statements */
c;
1 + 1;
1000;
"hello";
```

# Pointers

A *pointer* is a reference to an entity, e.g. to an object of type `int`.  By
itself it is just an object (= variable) whose value is the reference (= memory
address) to the entity.

Motivation:

- memory allocation / shared memory
- protocol buffer parsing
- pointer arithmetics

- the value stored in a pointer variable is the address of the memory storing
  the given pointer type
- declared like this, e.g.

```C
int *p; // pointer to an int
```

- note on style:

```C
int * p;
int *p;  // preferred in this lecture
```

- a pointer is always associated with a type

- to access the object the pointer points to, use a *dereference* operator `*`:

```C
printf("%d", *p);
```

- the dereference is also used to write a value to the object the pointer
  points to:

```C
*p = 5;
```

- in a declaration, you may assign like this:

```C
int i = 5;
int *p = &i;
```

- good practice is to prefix pointers with the 'p' letter, e.g.:

```C
int val;
int *pval = &val;
```

- the `&` above is an *address-of* operator and gets the address of the object
  (i.e. the memory address of where the value is stored)

- the pointer itself is obviously stored in memory too (it's just another
  variable).  With the declarations above, it looks as follows:

```
     p
     +---------------+
     |     addr2     |
     +---------------+        i
     ^                        +-------+
     |                        | 5     |
   addr1                      +-------+
                              ^
                              |
                            addr2
```

- the size of the pointer depends on the architecture and the way the program
  was compiled (see `-m32` / `-m64` command line switches of gcc)

- `sizeof (p)` will return the amount of memory to store the address of the
  object the pointer points to
- `sizeof (*p)` will return the amount needed to store the object the pointer
  points to

:wrench: write a program to print:

   - address of the pointer
   - the address where it points to
   - the value of the pointed to variable

Use the `%p` formatting for the first two.

:key: [ptr-basics.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/ptr-basics.c)

## Null pointer

- the real danger with pointers is that invalid memory access results in a crash
  (the program is terminated by kernel)
- can assign a number directly to a pointer (that should trigger a warning
  though.  We will get to casting and how to fix that later).

```C
int *p = 0x1234;
```

- zero pointer value cast to `void *` is called *a null pointer constant* and is
  also defined as a macro `NULL`
[in the C specification.](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/c99-standard.md)
  If a null pointer constant is converted to a pointer type such a pointer is
  called a *null pointer* and it is guaranteed in C not to point to any object
  or function.  In other words, dereferencing a null pointer is guaranteed to
  terminate the program.

	- we will talk about `void` later but it is **a type that has no
	  values**.  A pointer to such a type can never be dereferenced (as that
	  would give us a value of the type but we just defined such a value
	  does not exist).

	- this is because zero address is left unmapped on purpose, or a page
	  that cannot be accessed maps to the address.

	- the C specification says that the macro `NULL` must be defined in
	  `<stddef.h>`

```
int
main(void)
{
        void *p = 0;

        printf("%p\n", *p);
}

$ cc main.c
main.c: In function ‘main’:
main.c:8:24: warning: dereferencing ‘void *’ pointer
    8 |         printf("%p\n", *p);
      |                        ^~
main.c:8:24: error: invalid use of void expression
```

:wrench: create the null pointer (i.e. assign `0` to a pointer) and try to read
from and/or write to it (i.e. dereference such a pointer).

:key: [null-ptr.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/null-ptr.c)

## Basic operations

- notice the difference:

```C
int i;
int *p = &i;
```

vs.

```C
int i;
int *p;

// set value of the pointer (i.e. the address where it points to).
p = &i;
```

- operator precedence gotcha:
```C
*p		// value of the pointed to variable
*p + 1		// the value + 1
*(p + 1)	// the value on the address + 1 (see below for what it means)
```

- pointers of the same type can be assigned to one another

```C
int *p = 13;
int *p2 = p;
```

- note that the `&` reference operator is possible to use only on objects that
  may be assigned values.  The following is invalid then:

```C
p = &(i + 1);	// we cannot assign to (i + 1)
```

- store value to the address pointed to by the pointer:

```C
*p = 1;
```

## Changing pointers:

Pointers can be moved forward and backward

```C
p = p + 1;
p++;
p--;
```

**The pointer is moved by the amount of underlying data type when using
arithmetics.**

:wrench: create a pointer to an `int`, print it out, create a new pointer
that points to `p + 1`. See what is the difference between the 2 pointers.

:key: [ptr-diff.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/ptr-diff.c)

## Operator gotchas

- `*` has bigger precedence than `+` so:

```C
i = *p + 1;
```

is equal to

```C
i = (*p) + 1;
```

- postfix `++` has higher precedence than `*`:

```C
i = *p++;
```

is evaluated as `*(p++)` but it still does this
```C
i = *p; p++;
```

  - because `++` is used in postfix mode, ie. the value of expression `p++` is `p`:

# File API

Part of the standard since C90.

## Opening/closing

- `fopen` opens a file and returns an opaque handle (pointer)
  - getting `NULL` means an error
  - the `mode` argument controls the behavior: read, write, append
    - the `+` adds the other mode (write for read and vice versa, read for
      append)
  - write mode creates the file if it does not exist
  - the `b` binary mode usually does not have any effect (see
[the standard)](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/modules/c99-standard.md)
- `fclose` closes the handle
  - important to avoid resource leak (`fopen` can allocate both memory and file
    descriptor)
- `freopen` can be used to associate the standard streams (`stderr`, `stdin`, or
  `stdout`) with a file

:wrench: write a code that opens the same file in an cycle (until `fopen()`
fails) without calling `fclose()` on the handle. After how many iterations does
it fail on your system?

:eyes: [fopen-leak.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/fopen-leak.c)

## I/O

- `fprintf` - `printf` to a stream
- `fscanf`
  - basically parses text input from a stream according to format string
  - except the format string all the parameters must be pointers
- `fputs`/`fgets` - send/read string to/from a stream
- `fputc`/`fgetc` - send/read `char` to/from a stream
- `fwrite`/`fread` - for writing/reading binary data (such as structures or raw
  numeric types)

## Read a file

`fread`() reads a selected number of items of a given size to memory.  We can
use either an array or we can directly read to a variable through an operator
address-of.  In our case, we will be reading a file byte by byte, so we can give
`fread`() just an address of a character variable.

```C
char c;
FILE *fp;

/* Choose any other file you have on your system. */
if ((fp = fopen("/etc/passwd", "r")) == NULL)
	err(1, "fopen");

/*
 * fread() returns a number of *items* read.  In our case, it's the same
 * as number of bytes as we read it one byte at a time.
 */
while (fread(&c, sizeof (c), 1, fp) == 1) {
	putchar(c);
}

fclose(fp);
```

:eyes: [read-file.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/read-file.c)

:wrench: Note that you could read more characters at a time.  However, keep in
mind the 2nd argument is size of the element read, and the 3rd argument is how
many elements we read in one call.  For example:

```C
char a[16];
...
while ((n = fread(a, 1, sizeof (a), fp)) > 0) {
	/* process the bytes here */

	/* if we read less than requested, we hit end of file */
	if (n < sizeof (a))
		break;
}
```

Check the solution here:
:key: [read-file2.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/read-file2.c)

Also check manual page for `fread`() and ignore for now that the 1st argument is
of type `void *`, we will get there later.  As mentioned above, you can safely
put there an array or an address of a variable.

:wrench: Check the man page for `fwrite`() and modify the code so that what is
read from the file you write to some other file.  Do not remember to open the
output file for writing.  All the details are in the man page.

## Seeking

When reading/writing to a file using the above function, the current position
changes accordingly.  However, the position can be manipulated without
performing any I/O.

- `fseek` - moves the position
  - the `whence` parameter has 3 possible values and makes the `offset`
    parameter relative to:
    - `SEEK_SET` - the beginning of the file
    - `SEEK_END` - the end of the file
    - `SEEK_CUR` - the current location of the cursor in the file
- `ftell` - get current position in the file

# `err`() family of functions

- not defined by any standard however handy
- present in BSD, glibc (= Linux distros), Solaris, macOS, etc.
- use the `<err.h>` include, see the err(3) man page
- this is especially handy when working with I/O
- instead of writing:

```C
if (error) {
	fprintf(stderr, "error occured: %s\n", strerror(errno));
	exit(1);
}
```

- write the following

```C
if (error)
     err(1, "error occured: ");
```

- notice that a newline is inserted automatically at the end of the error
  message.
- or for functions that do not modify the `errno` value, use the *x* variant:

```C
if (some_error)
	errx(1, "ERROR: %d", some_error);
```

- there's also `warn()`/`warnx()` that do not exit the program


# :wrench: Home assignment

Note that home assignments are entirely voluntary but writing code is the only
way to learn a programming language.

## File of integers

:wrench: get a file size using the standard IO API (that is, `lseek(2)` is
prohibited even if you know it).

:wrench: create array of `int` values (of arbitrary positive length with values
ranging from `INT_MAX` to `0`), write the array to a file, read the values
into another array and print them to the standard error.
Between the writing and reading the file handle has to remain open. Use the
same file handle for reading and writing.
Use `od(1)` to verify the content of the file (thus it is handy to start with
`INT_MAX` and e.g. divide by 2 for each successive value).

:key: [fopen-binary.c](https://github.com/devnull-cz/c-prog-lang/blob/master/src/fopen-binary.c)

:wrench: use the file created by the previous program. Read the values from the
end of the file to the beginning of the file one by one without knowing the file
size and print the numbers to the standard error output.

## File read

:wrench: create a text file where each line begins with integer followed
by space and a string, e.g.:
```
42 towel
13 dwarfs and Snow White
```
Read the file using `fscanf()` and print the values (i.e. integer and a string)
from each line to standard output.
