# Function introduction

Functions can be used to encapsulate some work, for code re-factoring, etc.
Note that we have mentioned before that C supports [structured
programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structured_programming).

A function has a single return value and multiple input parameters.

- If you also need to extract an error code with the value or get multiple
  return values, that needs to be done via passing data via reference (more on
  that when we have pointers).
- I.e. this is not like Go that returns an error along with the data.

A function *declaration* is only declaring an API without its body.  In C, it
is called a *function prototype* and it consists of a type, a function name, and
an parameter list in parentheses.  For example:

```C
int digit(int c);
int space(int c);
float myfun(int c, int i, float f);
```

When *defining* the function, its body is inclosed in `{}` (just like the `main`
function).

```C
int
return_a_number(void)
{
	return (1000);
}
```

When we declare or define a function, the function has *parameters*.  When we
call such a function though, we pass in *arguments*.  So, for the above
mentioned function `digit`, if called as `digit(7)`, we passed argument `7` as
the parameter `c`.  Note that in the past these were also called, respectively,
*formal parameters* and *actual parameters*.

Also as with the `main` function, you can use `void` instead of the argument
list to say the function accepts no arguments.  You could just use `()` to
indicate the function has no arguments but that is an old way of doing things
and in that case the compiler will not verify the number of arguments when
calling the function (you can check it out for yourself).  So, always use
`(void)` if the function has no arguments.

```C
void
hola(void)
{
	printf("Hola!\n");
}
```

A function call is an expression so you can use it as such:

```C
printf("%d\n", return_a_number());
```

The default return value type is an `int` but a compiler will warn if it is
missing.  You should always specify the type in
#module c99-standard.md C99+
. You may use `void` which means the function returns no value.

Write your function declarations at the beginning of a C file or include those
into a separate header file.

If a compiler hits a function whose prototype is unknown, warnings are issued.
Remember #source hello-world1.c
? See also here:

```
$ cat test.c
int
main(void)
{
	fn();
}

float
fn(void)
{
	return (1.0);
}
$
$ gcc test.c
test.c:4:2: warning: implicit declaration of function 'fn' is
invalid in C99
      [-Wimplicit-function-declaration]
	fn();
	^
test.c:8:1: error: conflicting types for 'fn'
fn(void)
^
test.c:4:2: note: previous implicit declaration is here
	fn();
	^
1 warning and 1 error generated.
```

Parameter names may be omitted in prototypes, i.e.:

```C
int myfn(int, int);
```

A variable defined in function parameters or locally within the function
overrides global variables.  Each identifier is visible (= can be used) only
within a region of program text called its *scope*.  See
[C99](/modules/c99-standard.md), section *6.2.1 Scopes of identifiers* for more
information.

Within a function body, you may use its parameters as any other local variables.

```C
int
myfn(int i, int j)
{
	i = i * j;
	return (i);
}
```

As **arguments are always passed by value** in C, the variable value is not
changed in the caller:

```C
/* myfn defined here */

int
main(void)
{
	int i = 3;

	printf("%d\n", myfn(i, i));	// will print 9
	printf("%d\n", i);		// will print 3
}
```

Local variables are stored on a stack or in registers.

Argument passing depends on bitness and architecture. E.g. 32-bit x86 puts them
on the stack, 64-bit x64 ABI puts first 6 arguments to registers, the rest on a
the stack.

Functions can be recursive. #source recursive-fn.c

```C
/*
 * Print 0..9 recursively using a function call fn(9).
 */
#include <stdio.h>

void
myfn(int depth)
{
	if (depth != 0)
		myfn(depth - 1);
	printf("%d\n", depth);
}

int
main(void)
{
	myfn(9);
}

```
