# First, we assume you run the tests in a Unix/Linux environment.  If you do not
# have such an environment, either figure it out or log in to a Linux machine at
# the Mala Strana lab.  See http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang/ for more details.

# At least 2 GiB space in temporary directory used by the tests is needed to run
# the tests.

# Before running the tests via "./run-tests.sh", you need to set the "STEF"
# variable in your shell to the "stef.sh" script.  Get it here:
# https://github.com/devnull-cz/stef
#
# For example:
export STEF="/data/repos/stef/stef.sh"

# Then, you need to set the following two variables to the right values either
# in "test-config.local" or just export them in the same shell before executing
# "./run-tests.sh".  The test suite will build mytar itself using the MYTAR_C
# variable value.
#
# On Linux distros, GNU tar is just /bin/tar.
#
# On macOS, /bin/tar may NOT be a GNU tar.  With the MacPorts collection, GNUTAR
# should be set to /opt/local/bin/gnutar.  However, it still may work
# differently than Linux tar.  That is why you MUST pass the tests on one of the
# available u-pl<N> machine in the MFF UK lab (remotely accessible) that serve
# as our common environment.  See http://mff.devnull.cz/c-prog-lang for more
# information.
#
# Example:
export GNUTAR="$(which tar)"
export MYTAR_C="/data/repos/mytar/mytar.c"

# In order to verify your testing environment is set up correctly, set MYGNUTAR
# to the system GNU tar.  See the example output below for more information.
#
# Example:
###export MYGNUTAR="$(which gnutar)"

# When you have set STEF, GNUTAR, and MYTAR_C (or MYGNUTAR instead, see below),
# you are ready to run the tests:
#
# Phase 1
./run-tests.sh $(cat phase-1.tests)
# Phase 2
./run-tests.sh

# Example output to verify the testing environment with GNU tar.  You still need
# to set both GNUTAR.
