# Array of characters

An array of characters (`char`s) is called a *string* or a *string constant*.
Do not confuse it with a *character constant* as in `'A'` (single quotes) that
is actually an `int`.  A string is put in double quotes `""`.

So, `"hello, world"` as string.

Technically, a string constant is an array of characters and may be used to
initialize a char array:

```C
char foo[] = "bar";
```

A special thing is that a string is always terminated by a NUL (zero) byte.
That is how C knows where a string ends.

That means the size of the array is **one byte more than the number of
characters in the string**.  It is because of the terminating zero (`\0`) that
the compiler adds to terminate the string.

So, you could use an initializer as introduced earlier:

```C
char foo[] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', '\0' };

printf("%zu\n", sizeof (foo));		// prints 4
printf("%zu\n", sizeof ("bar"));	// prints 4
```

However, that is not generally used as you would normally use `"bar"` to
initialize such an array.

Using `'\0'` suggests it is a terminating NUL character, and it is just a zero
byte.  So, you could just use `0`, like this, but it is not generally used:

```C
char foo[] = { 'b', 'a', 'r', 0 };
```

To print a string via `printf`(), you use the `%s` conversion specifier:

```C
printf("%s\n", foo);
```

:wrench: What happens if you forget to specify the terminating zero in the above
per-char init and try to print the string ?

# Strings and String Literals

- `"xxx"` is called a *string literal* or a *string constant*

- in lays in a consecutive piece of memory: `'x' 'x' 'x' '\0'`

- `'\0'` terminates the string literal.  That's the C convention.

- a string literal internally initializes an array of characters from the
  string, with a `NUL` character appended.

- a *string* is a contiguous sequence of characters terminated by and including
  the first `NUL` character
  - so, a string literal may include multiple `NUL` characters, thus defining
    multiple strings.  In other words, a *string literal* and a *string* are two
    different things.

```C
int
main(void)
{
	char s[] = "hello, world\0, I arrived.";

	printf("%s\n", s);
}
```

```
$ gcc -Wall -Wextra main.c
$ ./a.out
hello, world
```

- `'\0'` is called a `NUL` character.  It's just a zero value byte but the
  convention is to use `'\0'` if it represents a string element.  `'\0'` is just
  a special case of octal representation `'\0ooo'` where 'o' is an octal figure
  (0-7).

- aside from the `{ 'x', ... }` initializer, character array initialization may
  be done also with a string literal:

```C
/* sizeof (a) is 6 as the terminating 0 is counted in */
char a[] = "hello";
```

- if `{}` is used for the initialization, you must add the terminating zero
  yourself unless you use the size of the array and the string was shorter (in
  which case the rest would be initialized to zero as usual):

```C
char s[] = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0' };
```

Anyway, you would probably never do it this way.  Just use `= "hello"`.

- string is printed via `printf()` as `%s`

```C
printf("%s\n", "hello, world");
```

# Warm-up

:wrench: task:

  - extend the program [tr-d-chars.c](/src/tr-d-chars.c) from last time to
    translate character input, e.g.
```
tail /etc/passwd | tr 'abcdefgh' '123#'
```
  - use character arrays defined with string literals to represent the 2 strings
    - see the tr(1) man page on what needs to happen if the 1st string is longer
      than the 2nd
      - do not store the expanded 2nd string as literal in your program !

  :eyes: code: [tr.c](/src/tr.c)

:wrench: task (bonus): refactor the code into a function(s)

- remember that arrays are passed into a function as a pointer (to be explained
  soon, not needed now) which can be used inside the function with an array
  subscript.

# The `for` loop

Formally defined as:

```
for (<init>; <predicate>; <update>)
	<body>
```

It is the same as:

```
<init>
while (<predicate>) {
	<body>
	<update>
}
```

Using the for loop is very often easier and more readable.

Example:
```C
int i;
for (i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	printf("%d\n", i);
```

Or in C99:

```C
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
	printf("%d\n", i);
```

- if the `break` jump statement happens in the body, the control is transferred
  to the end of the loop without executing the `<update>` part.
- with `continue` jump statement, the rest of the body is skipped.  The
  `<update>` part is then performed for the `for` loop but not for the `while`
  loop.
- both `break` and `continue` statements relate to the loop they are executed in

# Expressions

> "In mathematics, an expression or mathematical expression is a finite
combination of symbols that is well-formed according to rules that depend on
the context."

In C, expressions are, amongst others, variables, constants, strings, and
expressions in parentheses.  Also arithmetic expressions, relational
expressions, function calls, sizeof, assignments, and ternary expressions.

http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/expressions

In C99, an expression can produce results (2+2 gets 4) or generate side effects
(printf("foo") sends a string literal to the standard output).

:eyes: code: [expression-statement.c](/src/expression-statement.c)

:wrench: task: make the warning an error with your choice of compiler (would be
a variant of `-W` in GCC)

# Statements

Statements are (only from what we already learned), expressions, selections
(`if`, `switch` (not introduced yet)), `{}` blocks (known as *compounds*),
iterations, and jumps (`goto` (not introduced yet), `continue`, `break`,
`return`).

http://en.cppreference.com/w/c/language/statements

Basically, statements are pieces of code executed in sequence. The function body
is a compound statement. The compound statement (a.k.a. *block*) is a sequence
of statements and declarations. Blocks can be nested. Blocks inside a function
body are good for variable reuse.

A semicolon is not used after a compound statement but it is allowed.

**A declaration is not a statement** (there are subtle consequences, we can show
them later).

Some statements must end with `;`.  For example, expression statements.  The
following are all valid statements.  They do not make much sense though and will
probably generate a warning about an unused result.

```C
char c;

c;
1 + 1;
1000;
"hello";
```

:eyes: [null-statement.c](/src/null-statement.c),
[compound-statement.c](/src/compound-statement.c)

## w.r.t. compound statement vs. expression:

- It is not allowed to have a compound statement within an expression.
  - That said, GCC has a language extension (gcc99) that can be used to allow
    this - the reason is for protecting multiple evaluation within macros.
  - The C99 standard does not define it.
  - gotcha: the code has to be compiled with `gcc` with the `-pedantic-errors`
    option in order to reveal the problem

```
gcc -std=c99 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic-errors compound-statement-invalid.c
```

Our recommendation is to always use these options.

# `err`() family of functions

- not defined by any standard however handy
- present in BSD, glibc (= Linux distros), Solaris, macOS, etc.
- use the `<err.h>` include, see the err(3) man page
- this is especially handy when working with I/O
- instead of writing:

```C
if (error) {
	fprintf(stderr, "error occured: %s\n", strerror(errno));
	exit(1);
}
```

- write the following

```C
if (error)
     err(1, "error occured: ");
```

- notice that a newline is inserted automatically at the end of the error
  message.
- or for functions that do not modify the `errno` value, use the *x* variant:

```C
if (some_error)
	errx(1, "ERROR: %d", some_error);
```

- there's also `warn()`/`warnx()` that do not exit the program

# File API

Part of the standard since C90.

## Opening/closing

- `fopen` opens a file and returns an opaque handle (pointer)
  - `NULL` pointer means error
  - the `mode` argument controls the behavior: read, write, append
    - the `+` adds the other mode (write for read and vice versa, read for append)
  - write mode creates the file if it does not exist
  - the `b` binary mode usually does not have any effect (see [the standard](/modules/c99-standard.md))
- `fclose` closes the handle
  - important to avoid resource leak (it can allocate both memory and file
    descriptor)
- `freopen` can be used to associate the standard streams (`stderr`, `stdin`, or
  `stdout`) with a file

:wrench: write a code that opens the same file in an cycle (until `fopen()`
fails) without calling `fclose()` on the handle. After how many iterations does
it fail on your system?

:eyes: [fopen-leak.c](/src/fopen-leak.c)

## I/O

- `fprintf` - `printf` to a stream
- `fscanf` 
  - basically parses text input from a stream according to format string
  - except the format string all the parameters must be pointers
- `fputs`/`fgets` - send/read string to/from a stream
- `fputc`/`fgetc` - send/read `char` to/from a stream
- `fwrite`/`fread` - for writing/reading binary data (such as structures or raw
  numeric types)

:wrench: task: create a text file where each line begins with integer followed
by space and a string (`echo "1 foo" > file.txt; echo "2 bar" >> file.txt`).
Read the file using `fscanf()` and print the values (i.e. integer and a string)
from each line to standard output.

## Seeking

When reading/writing to a file using the above function, the current position
changes accordingly.  However, the position can be manipulated without
performing any I/O.

- `fseek` - moves the position
  - the `whence` parameter has 3 possible values and makes the `offset`
    parameter relative to:
    - `SEEK_SET` - the beginning of the file
    - `SEEK_END` - the end of the file
    - `SEEK_CUR` - the current location of the cursor in the file
- `ftell` - get current position in the file

:wrench: get a file size using the standard IO API (that is, `lseek(2)` is
prohibited even if you know it).

:wrench: write array of `int` values (use an arbitrary positive count with values
ranging from `INT_MAX` to `0`) to a file and read the values into another array
and print them to the standard error output without closing the file in between
the writing and reading. Use `od(1)` to verify the content of the file (thus it
is handy to start with `INT_MAX` and e.g. divide by 2 for each successive
value).  :eyes: [fopen-binary.c](/src/fopen-binary.c)

:wrench: use the file created by the previous program. Read the values from the
end of the file to the beginning of the file one by one without knowing the file
size and print the numbers to the standard error output.

# Pointers

Motivation:

- memory allocation / shared memory
- protocol buffer parsing
- pointer arithmetics

- the value stored in a pointer variable is the address of the memory storing
  the given pointer type
- declared like this, e.g.

`int *p; // pointer to an int`

- note on style:

```C
int * p;
int *p;  // preferred in this lecture
```

- good practice is to prefix pointers with the 'p' letter

- a pointer is always associated with a type

- to access the object the pointer points to, use a *dereference* operator `*`:

```C
printf("%d", *p);
```

- the dereference is also used to write a value to the variable pointed:

```C
*p = 5;
```

- in a declaration, you may assign like this:

```C
int i = 5;
int *p = &i;
```

- the `&` is an *address-of* operator and gets the address of the variable.

- the pointer itself is obviously stored in memory too

```
     p
     +---------------+
     |     addr2     |
     +---------------+        i
     ^                        +-------+
     |                        | 5     |
   addr1                      +-------+
                              ^
                              |
                            addr2
```

- the size of the pointer depends on architecture and the way the program was
  compiled (see `-m32` / `-m64` command line switches of gcc)

- `sizeof (p)` will return the amount of memory to store the address of the
  object the pointer points to
- `sizeof (*p)` will return the amount needed to store the object the pointer
  points to

:wrench: Task: write a program to print:

   - address of the pointer
   - the address where it points to
   - the value of the pointed to variable

Use the `%p` formatting for the first two.

:eyes: Code: [ptr-basics.c](/src/ptr-basics.c)

## NULL pointer

- the real danger with pointers is that invalid access results in a crash (the
  program is terminated by kernel)
  - this is because `NULL` address is left unmapped on purpose, or a page that
    cannot be accessed maps to the address.  Note that C guarantees that zero is
    never a valid address for data.
- can assign a number directly to a pointer (that should trigger a warning
  though.  We will get to casting and how to fix that later).

```C
int *p = 0x1234;
```

- special pointer value, `NULL`, is defined and it is called *a null pointer
  constant* [in the C spec](/modules/c99-standard.md).

:wrench: Task: create NULL pointer and try to read from it / write to it

:eyes: Code: [null-ptr.c](/src/null-ptr.c)

## Basic operations

- notice the difference:

```C
int i;
int *p = &i;
```

vs.

```C
int i;
int *p;

// set value of the pointer (i.e. the address where it points to).
p = &i;
```

- operator precedence gotcha:
```
*p		// value of the pointed to variable
*p + 1		// the value + 1
*(p + 1)	// the value on the address + 1 (see below for what it
		// means)
```
- note that the & reference operator is possible to use only on variables
  - thus this is invalid:

```
p = &(i + 1);
```

- store value to the address pointed to by the pointer:

```
*p = 1;
```

## Changing pointers:

- pointers can be moved forward and backward

```
p = p + 1;
p++;
p--;
```

## operator gotchas

- `*` has bigger precedence than `+` so:

```
i = *p + 1;
```

is equal to

```
i = (*p) + 1;
```

- postfix `++` has higher precedence than `*`:

```
i = *p++;
```

is evaluated as `*(p++)` but it still does the following because `++` is used in
postfix mode, ie. the value of expression `p++` is `p`:

```
i = *p; p++;
```

- the pointer is moved by the amount of underlying (domain) data type when using
  arithmetics

# :wrench: Home assignment

Note that home assignments are entirely voluntary but writing code is the only
way to learn a programming language.

## Pointer difference

:wrench: Task: create a pointer to an `int`, print it out, create a new pointer
that points to `p + 1`. See what is the difference between the 2 pointers.
